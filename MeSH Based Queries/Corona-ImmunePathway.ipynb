      "[{'text': 'The majority of studies addressing T cell responses to respiratory virus infections come from mice infected with a variety of natural and mouse-adapted pathogens. A few studies use natural mouse pathogens such as Sendai virus, a mouse para-influenza type I pathogen and mouse hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1). More commonly, mouse-adapted stains of human pathogens such as the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) or A/WSN/33 H1N1 (WSN) strains of influenza and SARS-CoV-MA15 have been used to study innate and adaptive immune responses [25, 30] . Initiation of the immune response against invading pathogens begins with direct infection of airway epithelium. Following initial infection, lung-resident respiratory dendritic cells (rDCs) acquire the invading pathogen or antigens from infected epithelial cells, become activated, process antigen and migrate to the draining (mediastinal and cervical) lymph nodes (DLN). Once in the DLNs, rDCs present the processed antigen in the form of MHC/peptide complex to naïve circulating T cells. Following engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) with peptide-MHC complex and additional co-stimulatory signals, T cells become activated, proliferate vigorously and migrate to the site of infection [31] [32] [33] (Fig. 1 ). Once at the site of infection, activated virus-specific effector T cells produce antiviral cytokines (IFN-c, TNF-a, IL-2), chemokines (CXCL-9, 10 and 11) and cytotoxic molecules (perforin and granzyme B) [34] . Effector cytokines such as IFN-c directly inhibit viral replication and enhance antigen presentation [35] . The chemokines produced by activated T cells recruit more innate and adaptive cells to control pathogen burden. Cytotoxic molecules such as granzyme B directly kill infected epithelial cells and help eliminate the pathogen [36] [37] [38] [39] . Despite a wealth of information on the T cell response to many respiratory pathogens, less is known about the respiratory coronavirus infections.'}]\n",
      "[{'text': 'Primary pulmonary infections were the most common cause of PARDS in the PARDIE study, underlying two-thirds of the cases of PARDS identified. These \"direct\" PARDS cases had lower mortality than \"indirect\" causes like sepsis and non-septic shock [12] . Primary pulmonary infections leading to ARDS can be related to a viral etiology, bacterial etiology, or both as in the case of influenza leading to a Staphylococcus aureus infection. Much attention has been paid to pandemic viruses that can lead to drastic increases in ARDS patients: influenza, including H1N1; Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [43] . Interestingly, the extreme virulence of these coronavirus infections is now thought to be immune mediated, with very early and exaggerated activation of the complement cascade [44] . More commonly, viral etiologies are those that cause the upper respiratory infections and bronchiolitis cases commonly encountered in the pediatric intensive care unit: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus [43, 45] . Similarly, bacterial causes of PARDS are often the common pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus [46] . As expected, immunosuppression also places patients at greater risk for fungal and parasitic causes of ARDS, including Pneumocystis jirovecii [46] . These patients retain a higher mortality regardless of ARDS severity [10] . Finally, as the PALICC definition now also allows for patients with chronic lung disease to be diagnosed with PARDS, we may see an increase in pathogens specific to technology-dependent and chronically ventilated patients as important PARDS etiologies soon.'}]\n",
      "[{'text': 'TLRs and RLRs are the principal pattern recognition receptors that sense virus infection and mount a defense by activation of an innate immune response (reviewed in [3, 4] ). However, it has also been observed under many circumstances that the TLR-and/or RLR-mediated innate immune response plays a critical role in viral pathogenesis. For example, pneumonia caused by influenza virus or SARS-coronavirus infections [30, 31, 32] , hemorrhagic fever caused by dengue virus and many other viruses [2, 33] and encephalitis caused by West Nile virus infection [34] have all been demonstrated to be largely due to the detrimental effects of proinflammatory cytokines induced by the infection itself. Moreover, the identification of TLRs and RLRs as key pathogen recognition receptors for innate immunity has sparked great interest in therapeutic manipulation of the innate immune system. TLR and RLR agonists are being developed for the treatment of cancer, allergies and viral infections, and as adjuvants for vaccines to prevent or treat cancer and infectious diseases [8, 35] . Despite tremendous efforts, only imiquimod (Aldara), a TLR7 agonist, has been approved by US FDA for treatment of papillomavirusinduced genital warts and basal cell carcinoma via topical use [36] . Due to the activation of a wide-spectrum of cellular responses, it is not surprising that systematic administration of the TLR agonists in doses necessary to achieve antiviral or anti-tumor effects is usually associated with significant adverse effects [11, 12, 13, 14] .'}, {'text': 'Immunomodulation, as a therapy, offers several advantages over conventional antiviral strategies. Because the host is the target of such a therapy, immunomodulation avoids the selective pressure on the pathogen that leads to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In addition, because of the non-specific nature of the innate immune system, its modulation could result in broad-spectrum protection against a wide range of microbial pathogens. The use of immunomodulators for viral infections has been most extensively investigated for chronic infections such as HIV and viral hepatitis infections and some of these agents like interferon are in clinical use [70] . With the advent of severe respiratory distress syndromes due to A/H5N1 avian influenza and SARS-coronavirus infections and in particular since the 2009 influenza pandemic, the interest for immunomodulators in acute viral infections has been increasing. Several antiinflammatory therapies for influenza A infections have been evaluated so far, including sphingosine analogues, NF-κB inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides, COX-2 inhibitors and macrolides [71] [72] [73] . The latter are antibiotics with known antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that have shown promising results in several viral respiratory infections caused by influenza A, rhinovirus and hRSV [74] . Like macrolides, PAR1 antagonists may have a broad spectrum of activity. Indeed, Khoufache et al. recently reported results similar to ours in murine models of influenza A infections including those caused by A/H5N1 and oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) pdm09 strains [44] . In addition, unpublished data from our group indicates that PAR1 antagonists can significantly decrease hRSV lung titers and key pulmonary cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES) in a similar mouse model highlighting the broad-spectrum potential of these compounds.'}, {'text': 'Taken together, the results of our study and others suggest that inactivation of IRF3 by nsp3 may contribute to the weak IFN response in coronavirus infections. Ultimate understanding of the overall interactions between coronaviruses and the host innate immune system will provide further insight into the pathogenesis of viruses in this class, and open a new avenue of therapeutic target exploration against coronavirus infections.'}, {'text': 'ISGs were shown to target virtually all steps of the viral cycle in order to restrict viral replication (Schoggins and Rice 2011). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play a role in the induction of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and were linked to countering coronavirus infections through several studies [reviewed in (Mizutani 2007) ]. IBV has evolved a strategy to counteract IL-6 and IL-8 expression by inducing the expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), a negative regulator of p38 MAPK, although it has remained unclear which viral protein(s) is responsible (Liao et al. 2011) . Innate immune and inflammatory signaling pathways are extensively regulated in order to prevent adverse effects of their over-stimulation. Apart from phosphorylation and other regulatory mechanisms, the system is controlled by ubiquitination at numerous points in the signal transduction cascade. For example, RIG-I, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) were shown to be activated by Lys63-linked ubiquitination (Jiang and Chen 2012) . The importance of the innate immune system in the context of coronavirus infections can be illustrated in at least three ways. First, in severe cases of SARS the pathology was associated with aberrant or hyper-activation of innate immune signaling. This resulted in the aberrant production of interferons and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-10 and TNF-alpha in the lungs [reviewed in (Totura and Baric 2012) ]. Interestingly, a systems biology study that evaluated the transcriptome after infection of cultured cells with two different human MERS-CoV isolates (MERS-CoV Eng 1 vs. SA 1) suggested that viral sequence differences relate to variations in innate immune evasion, which may in turn result in different immune responses. These differences may link to differential STAT3 activation leading to activation or inhibition of, e.g., IFN, NF-jB, and IRF7 (Selinger et al. 2014 ). Second, as described in Chap. 4, coronaviruses employ elaborate mechanisms to shield the viral replication machinery from the innate immune sensors in the cytosol. Third, besides the presumed shielding of viral PAMPs by the replication organelles, coronaviruses seem to encode numerous gene products that actively counteract or help to circumvent innate immune responses [reviewed in (Totura and Baric 2012; Kindler and Thiel 2014; Vijay and Perlman 2016) ].'}]\n"

      "[{'text': 'The pulmonary complications in human CoViD-19 patients are due to an exuberant local inflammatory response with diffuse alveolar damage. Patients dying because of SARS have lung consolidation, edema and mucopurulent material in the bronchial tree. At microscopic examination, alterations such as diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane and fibrin formation, neutrophils and macrophages infiltrates were detected in the interstitium and alveoli. Similar features were noted in the only human autopsy report available of MERS infection. Cytokines and chemokines play a key role in the immune response against viral infections, and their altered production has been demonstrated in both SARS and MERS coronavirus infections. Such altered levels have been shown to be likely due to the low synthesis of antiviral cytokines such as interferons (IFN)α or β and in concert increased levels of other pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines that have pathogenic consequences. Among them, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines were shown to be significantly more elevated in patients with severe compared to uncomplicated SARS or MERS infection [10, 11] . Recent preliminary data from China reported high plasma levels of cytokines including IL-6, related to the severity and the prognosis of the disease with a clear implication for the occurrence of \"cytokine storm\" and CRS. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody that has been used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, has been used and approved for treatment of a variety of clinical conditions that include CRS. These have included clinical conditions such as those associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy that appears to induce severe or lifethreatening cytokine release syndrome [12] . A single dose of tocilizumab was used in 21 patients in China suffering from severe respiratory syndrome during CoViD-19 infection, at the dosage of 400 mg intravenously, in addition to routine therapy. In a few days, 90% of patients recovered and lung opacities disappeared [13] , suggesting that anti-IL-6 might be a powerful potential rescue therapy in respiratory distress syndrome of CoViD-19. A potential role for anti-IL1 biologics could be hypothesized from data showing an activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by SARS-CoV, with secretion of IL-1β. Studies have demonstrated that inflammasome activation also occurs in SARS-CoV2 infection, especially within lymphoid cells and patients have increased serum IL-1β [14] . Another potential treatment under evaluation for SARS-CoV2 related acute respiratory disease is baricitinib, an oral drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis patients that functions as a blocker of Janus Kinases (JAK) 1 and 2, enzymes associated with intracellular signaling, including Type I and type II IFN signaling. One rationale for its use is based on the fact that viruses such as SARS-CoV2 utilize a protein expressed on its spike to bind to the ACE2 receptor and enter cells through a mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis. One of the known regulators of receptor mediated endocytosis is a kinase termed the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). Baricitinib has high affinity for AAK1. Inhibition of AAK1 is reasoned to not only inhibit receptor mediated endocytosis (blocking intracellular entry of the virus) but it may also function in the intracellular assembly of virus particles [15] . The plasma concentration of baricitinib at its current therapeutic dosage (2 or 4 mg orally once daily) is sufficient to inhibit AAK1, thus it may be able to reduce both the viral entry and the inflammation characteristic of CoViD-19 patients.'}]\n",
      "[{'text': 'Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by internally arising 3c and S gene mutants of a ubiquitous and largely non-pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Chang et al., 2012; Pedersen et al., 2012) . The resultant FIP viruses (FIPVs) cause disease mainly among young cats from pedigreed catteries, shelters, and other dense multi-cat environments. FIP prevalence is around 1-5% in these populations, but mortality among affected cats is virtually 100% once clinical signs appear (Pedersen, 2009 ). This suggests that either the FECV-to-FIPV mutation rate is very low or that most infections are abortive. The first scenario is unlikely based on two different studies. Chang et al. (2012) calculated that thousands of FECV progeny carrying the S protein mutation occur during any single infection. Another study indicated that the FECV-to-FIPV mutation and FIP occurs in at least 20% of older cats following FECV exposure, but only in individuals that were immunocompromised (Poland et al., 1996) . Therefore, additional extrinsic (environment) or intrinsic (host) factors must play an important role in actual disease occurrence. Extrinsic factors that increase the level of exposure to FECV (Foley et al., 1997) or that depress the immune system at the time of initial FECV infection (reviewed Pedersen, 2009; Poland et al., 1996) affect FIP prevalence. Age at the time of initial FECV exposure, which usually occurs around 9 weeks of age (Pedersen et al., 2008) , may also be a critical factor, because the adaptive immune system of kittens is still maturing during this period (Pedersen, 1987) . Kittens from dense multi-cat environments such as catteries and shelters are often under heavy stress due to the effects of overpopulation, diet changes, early weaning and exposure to a myriad of other common kitten-hood infections (Pedersen, 2009) .'}]\n",

Coronaviruses gain entry into the host via respiratory or intestinal epithelium where there are numerous DCs. APN/CD13 is expressed by specific DC subsets and is important in maturation of DCs, extracellular degradation of antigens, and may be involved in T-cell activation (Amoscato et al., 1998; Liu, 2001; Summers et al., 2001; Woodhead et al., 2000) . Consequently, we studied mAPN and hAPN expression on dendritic cells derived from the bone marrow (BM-DCs) of non-transgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice. Expressions of surface proteins including MHC I, CEACAM1a, mouse APN, and CD11c were very similar in both the nontransgenic and the hAPN-transgenic mice. In contrast, hAPN was only expressed by the DC-enriched population derived from the hAPN-transgenic mice. BM-DCs isolated from the hAPN-transgenic mice were susceptible to HCoV-229E, whereas BM-DCs derived from non-transgenic mice were not. Our data demonstrate that DCs from hAPNtransgenic mice are infected by HCoV-229E in a receptordependent fashion, and Thiel et al. have shown that HCoV-229E virus-like particles transduce human DCs (Thiel et al., 2003) . Therefore, DCs in the human respiratory epithelium may play a role in the initiation of HCoV-229E infection and its dissemination to other tissues. Other group 1 coronaviruses that infect cats and pigs may also infect DCs via their cognate APN receptors (Delmas et al., 1992; Tresnan et al., 1996) . Mouse DCs are also infected by mouse hepatitis virus-A59, a group 2 coronavirus, in a CEACAM1a receptor-dependent manner (Turner et al., 2004) . DC-coronavirus interaction may be a common evolutionary mechanism of entry, dissemination, immunomodulation, and pathogenesis observed in diverse coronaviruses, including feline infectious peritonitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and HCoV-229E Jeffers et al., 2004; Konikova et al., 1998; Thiel et al., 2003; Turner et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004) . In other viruses, such as LCMV and measles, infection of DCs leads to severe immunomodulation, impairment of antigen presentation, and cytokine expression (Borrow et al., 1995; Hahm et al., 2004; Naniche and Oldstone, 2000) .

It has been established that TGEV binds the pAPN receptor on the surface of swine enterocytes (Delmas et al., 1992 (Delmas et al., , 1994 . Additionally, TGEV along with CCoV, TGEV and HCoV-229E exhibit cross-binding activities to feline APN (fAPN), which is the major receptor for feline infectious peritonitis virus and it has been demonstrated that these viruses can utilize this receptor to infect fAPN-expressing BHK21 and NIH3T3 cells (Tresnan et al., 1996; Tusell and Holmes, 2006; Tusell et al., 2007) . PEDV was also reported to interact with pAPN in porcine enterocytes (Li et al., 2009) , and is capable of infecting MDCK and ST cells expressing the pAPN receptor (Oh et al., 2003; Nam and Lee, 2010) . More recently, Li et al. reported pAPN is important receptor for PEDV infection in swine small intestine (IECs). They found higher expression increased the susceptibility by PEDV, and this was confirmed by siRNA inhibition results. They also found PEDV enters via apical plasma membrane and released from there in polarized epithelial cells (Cong et al., 2015) . Other group reported that porcine and human APN serve as efficient receptor for PEDV infection (Li, 2015) . They found although TGEV Spike protein bound porcine APN much more tightly than human APN, PEDV Spike protein efficiently bound both porcine and human APN. They also reported that Neu5Ac as the PEDV coreceptor. Very recently, Shirato et al. reported pAPN is not functional receptor for PEDV but promotes the its infection through protease activity (Shirato et al., 2016) .

This disease has fascinated cat researchers for already half a century (Holzworth, 1963) but up until now, it cannot be treated/ controlled in an efficient way. None of the conventional antivirals and therapeutics have been found effective against FIPV infection (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008) . At present, it is the most important viral cause of death in cats. The current hypothesis states that FIPV arises through mutation from the avirulent coronavirus feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Chang et al., 2010) . Additionally, FIPV is very immune evasive, especially toward the humoral branch of immunity (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Cornelissen et al., 2007; Dewerchin et al., 2008) . About 30 years ago, Pedersen and Black (1983) already stated that a strong cell-mediated immune response (CMI) is key to surviving a FIPV infection. Cats with a strong CMI would survive, while A strong cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is thought to be indispensable for protection against infection with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in cats. In this study, the role of natural killer (NK) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), central players in the innate and adaptive CMI respectively, was examined during natural FIPV infection. When quantified, both NK cells and Tregs were drastically depleted from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node (LN) and spleen in FIP cats. In contrast, mesentery and kidney from FIP cats did not show any difference when compared to healthy non-infected control animals. In addition, other regulatory lymphocytes (CD4+CD25ÀFoxp3+ and CD3+CD8+Foxp3+) were found to be depleted from blood and LN as well. Phenotypic analysis of blood-derived NK cells in FIP cats revealed an upregulation of activation markers (CD16 and CD25) and migration markers (CD11b and CD62L) while LN-derived NK cells showed upregulation of only CD16 and CD62L. LN-derived NK cells from FIPV-infected cats were also significantly less cytotoxic when compared with healthy cats. This study reveals for the first time that FIPV infection is associated with severe suppression of NK cells and Tregs, which is reflected by cell depletion and lowered cell functionality (only NK cells). This will undoubtfully lead to a reduced capacity of the innate immune system (NK cells) to battle FIPV infection and a decreased capacity (Tregs) to suppress the immunopathology typical for FIP. However, these results will also open possibilities for new therapies targeting specifically NK cells and Tregs to enhance their numbers and/or functionality during FIPV infection.'}]\n",

The ability of PRRs to engage different adaptor proteins, crosstalk with other regulatory pathways and suppress or activate a plethora of kinases involved in a multitude of signaling pathways is an essential factor in shaping the type, strength, magnitude, timing and duration of inflammation and antiviral responses. This multidimensional signaling network precisely regulates both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Nevertheless, our knowledge of inflammation and antiviral biology is still in its infancy and many problems remain obscure. Specifically, the substantial antimicrobial mechanisms actually are beyond our understanding. Furthermore, we do not know much about the dynamic regulation of the entire immune system caused by crosstalk of multiple signaling cascades as well as the mechanisms fine-tuning the innate and adaptive immunity.

Bat-associated viruses are known to cause severe disease in humans, and rabies has been recognized for centuries in this regard. Many zoonotic viruses that have emerged recently are thought to have their origins in bats. For example, Chinese horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are thought to be the source of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which emerged in South China via an intermediate host (caged civets) and then caused significant mortality in humans (Ge et al., 2013; Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006) .

Since infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly, vaccinations appear to be the optimal tool to promote healthy aging 11 . Four vaccines are currently recommended for individuals older than 60 years to protect against influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus and pertussis infections and to prevent zoster reactivation. All four of them are against antigens for which immune memory already exists. Three of them induce at least in part recall responses while the current pneumococcal vaccine is a polysaccharide vaccine that mostly induces a T cell-independent B cell response. Of these four vaccines, only the tetanus-reduced diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine gives a satisfactory, but reduced protective antibody response compared to young adults 12 . In contrast, vaccines for influenza or pneumococcal disease fail to induce protective immunity in a large proportion of the elderly population, but at least appear to be able to mitigate disease to some degree 13, 14 . Similarly, vaccination with the live varicella virus zoster vaccine only partially prevents herpes zoster reactivation or attenuates the severity of postherpetic neuralgia 15, 16 . Primary immune responses are equally or maybe even more compromised in the elderly than secondary responses, as illustrated by the poor vaccine response to hepatitis B 17 , the side effects from yellow fever vaccination or the disease severity of West Nile virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). More than five decades of experience and the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic have provided an unparalleled understanding of influenza vaccinations 18 . While most observational studies report a weak increase in hemagglutination antibody inhibitiontiters and mitigation of disease severity, some epidemiological studies have questioned the benefit from the annual influenza vaccination 19, 20 . Attempts at improving vaccine outcomes have included the use of adjuvant, higher vaccine doses or booster vaccination, but such strategies have been of limited benefit [21] [22] [23] . The live influenza vaccine was not efficacious and is therefore not approved in individuals older than 50 years 24 . A better understanding of the mechanisms in immune aging is indispensable to optimally target age-related defects and to restore vaccine responses to a level that vaccination is becoming an effective tool to promote healthy aging. While effective vaccine responses depend on the cooperative action of the innate and adaptive immune systems both of which are subject to aging, this review will mainly focus on the adaptive arm.

TLR4 signaling, for example, is thought to be important for the hypercytokinemia seen during gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis. 14 In mice, repeated stimulation of TLR9, a receptor for unmethylated 5 0 -C-phosphate-G-3 0 (CpG) DNA of numerous bacteria and viruses, 15 leads to a cytokine storm that triggers clinical and laboratory features resembling HLH secondary to infections. 16, 17 Cytokines such as interferon g (IFNg), tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), interleukin-1 b, and interleukin-18 have been extensively studied in the context of clinical hypercytokinemia. [18] [19] [20] Of these, IFNg is considered to be the dominant cytokine affording biological effects on potentially all cells by virtue of the ubiquitous expression of the cognate receptor. 21 Produced by cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems, including natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T cells, T cells, neutrophils and dendritic cells, 16, 22, 23 IFNg is well place to serve as the instigating mediator of cytokine release syndromes.

In the model of TLR9-induced cytokine release syndrome, IFNg was shown to be critical for the development of some features of sHLH including cytopenias and hepatic dysfunction. 16, 17 Although these findings are intriguing, their relevance to the pathophysiology of human disease remains to be proven.'}, {'text': 'Studies of infections reveal many host-pathogen interactions, with genetic variation in both the host and the pathogen genomes (Garantziotis and Schwartz, 2010) .

G × E studies have had practical value in diagnosis, epidemiological surveillance, and targeted therapies of multiple infectious diseases. Genomics has played a critical role in understanding the evolution and pathogenicity of antigenic variation of influenza strains, origins of HIV/AIDS retroviruses, transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (and other viruses) from animals to humans, spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis, and highly differential susceptibility to the vivax form of malaria (Omenn, 2010b) . Hyporesponsive TLR4 polymorphisms and a CD14 SNP associated with higher circulating levels of CD14 are associated with increased mortality from sepsis in adults and from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk infants due to prematurity or congenital heart disease. SNPs in the vitamin D receptor gene VDR are associated with increased susceptibility to severe RSV and tuberculosis (TB). Conversely, an S180L TIRAP polymorphism is associated with reduced response to TLR2 and TLR4 activation in vitro and risk for developing TB. As more is learned about predisposition or resistance to infections, screening of potentially or definitely exposed animal-care and healthcare workers may be an important application.'}, {'text': 'We thank Dr Wiwanitkit for his interest in our recent article in which we discussed the important findings and unanswered questions on the evolving epidemic caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 1 Until now, the epidemic has not been completely controlled despite international collaborations, and fears of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like largescale epidemic continue to mount. 2 The total number of laboratory-confirmed and fatal cases keeps on increasing, and person-to-person transmission is evident in several recent outbreaks. 1 Furthermore, the definitive natural reservoirs and possible intermediate animal hosts have not yet been successfully identified. As pointed out by Dr Wiwanitkit, an increasing number of novel emerging viruses have likely originated from animals, especially bats and birds. 3 Asymptomatic shedding, dissemination, and mixing of different viruses are facilitated by the high species biodiversity, roosting and migratory behaviors, and unique adaptive immune system of bats and birds. 3 The identification and segregation of the definitive natural reservoirs and intermediate animal species from humans would be important measures to prevent further interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV from animals to humans.'}, {'text': 'The complement system is an essential component of innate immunity and has evolved as an important bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems. 41, 42 Pulmonary viral infection can result in complement activation both locally (in the lungs) and systemically. Complement deficiency (ie, in components C3, C3a, and C5a) in mice causes markedly reduced T-cell responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 43, 44 and IAV infection, 45, 46 resulting in a reduced survival rate. In a recent study complement deficiency had no effect on the ability of DCs to trigger T-cell responses after influenza infection but instead resulted in diminished lung DC migration and accumulation into the lung draining lymph nodes (mediastinal lymph node [MLN]), 46 suggesting a potential mechanism for the aforementioned impaired anti-IAV T-cell response in infected lungs. In this connection it is noteworthy that the CD103 + lung DC subset, which plays a prominent role in the induction of the adaptive immune T-cell response to viral respiratory tract infection in the MLNs, is now recognized to have the unique capacity to both sense and produce complement, thereby controlling both its own migration and the migration of CD11b + respiratory DCs from the infected lung into the MLNs. Intriguingly, emerging evidence suggests that certain complement components (eg, C1q) can also either negatively or positively regulate inflammasome activation, depending on the disease. 47, 48 Thus components of the complement pathway might, like viral PAMPs and cellular DAMPs, provide additional immunologic cues to regulate host immunity to viral infection.'}, {'text': 'Recently, interest in health-promoting foods and ingredients has been gradually increasing, attributable to the incidence of new infectious diseases, such as H1N1 influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

In addition, they have been attracting a great deal of interest from the food and biopharmaceutical industries. It is well known that herbal and mushroom extracts include immunostimulatory polysaccharides that promote immune functions by activating the innate and adaptive immune systems (Park et al., 2009; Volman et al., 2010; Wasser, 2002) . Indeed, a primary mechanism of immune system potentiation by natural polysaccharides likely involves their ability to activate macrophage and NK cells, as well as the complement system'}, {'text': 'Asthma is classically defined as a disease orchestrated by the adaptive immune system. However, recent advances suggest considerable crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune systems in initiation and propagation of allergic immune response. 5 Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors, are key components of the innate immune system that have been found to play an important role in allergic inflammation. PRRs on epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs) recognize pathogenassociated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns and act as adjuvants in directing allergen sensitization. [6] [7] [8] Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a prototypic soluble PRR involved in the regulation of inflammation through multiple mechanisms that include interaction with components of complement pathways, Fcg receptors, pathogenic moieties on microbes, and regulation of leukocyte migration. 9 Previously, lack of PTX3 has been reported to exaggerate inflammation in the setting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, aspergillosis, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice. The protective role of exogenous PTX3 in aspergillosis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis further strengthens the preceding observations (reviewed by Balhara et al 9 ) . Collectively, these studies demonstrate that infection and lung injury increase PTX3 production in the lung. 9 Previously published data by our group 10 showed enhanced PTX3 expression in the lungs of patients with severe allergic asthma compared with that in healthy donors. Structural cells, particularly epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells, were the main producers of PTX3 in vivo and on proinflammatory cytokine stimulation in vitro. However, the role of PTX3 in the development of allergic asthma remains unknown.'}]\n"

In 2006, for example, during an outbreak of pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections in 26 states of the US, which was caused by contaminated spinach, isolates of the pathogen were recovered from cows and wild pigs (the zoonotic reservoirs), bags of spinach (the vehicle of transmission), and ill patients (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/ mmwrhtml/mm55d926a1.htm). One of these isolates was designated as the reference for the outbreak based on conserved PFGE patterns. Genome sequencing of several isolates from the same outbreak performed in our laboratory, however, revealed genomic variations that questioned a direct evolutionary link between all outbreak-associated isolates (Eppinger et al., unpublished data). Comparative genomics followed by whole-genome phylogenetic analyses based on single nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated that these isolates were indeed closely related to one another and only distantly related to other E. coli O157:H7 isolates, hence linking all isolates to the same outbreak, something that was not possible using PFGE patterns. In this case, phylogenetic analyses suggest that several highly related genotypes were at the source of the outbreak, thus challenging the Box 2. Pandemic H1N1 2009 Influenza: A Recent Example of the Impact of Genomics on Biopreparedness Genomics can be readily applied to follow outbreaks of infectious diseases. This is clearly illustrated during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003 and the emergence and worldwide spread of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus this year. In both cases, genomics played a key role in the immediate response to the outbreak. Initially, very little was known about the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak. Pangenomic virus microarrays identified it as a coronavirus [23] ; however, it was only through detailed sequencing that the specific genotype of this virus could be determined [24] . Comparative sequence analysis identified the SARS virus as distinct from other coronaviruses in terms of its encoded proteins responsible for antigen presentation. This finding ultimately lead to development of diagnostics [25] and potential therapeutics [26] . This example of a sequencing approach as a rapid response to a virus outbreak demonstrates that genomics can be a useful and important, if not essential, epidemiological tool. In the ongoing H1N1 influenza outbreak, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) established the Influenza Virus Resource (a database and tool for flu sequence analysis, annotation, and submission to GenBank; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/SwineFlu. html), containing 462 complete viral genome sequences from worldwide viral samples (as of September, 2009). Some of the genomic data was completed, compared, and released to the public within two weeks of isolation of the DNA. The rapid generation of genome sequence data is providing a paradigm shift in the analysis of infectious disease outbreaks, from more classical methods of isolation to the rapid molecular examination of the pathogen in question.'}, {'text': 'One of the strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency uses intracellular targeting strategies to enhance MHC class I antigen presentation and processing in DCs.

Oxidative stress associated with aging has been attributed to the initiation and maintenance of chronic low-grade inflammation (\"inflammaging\"; Cannizzo et al., 2011) . A consequence of immunosenescence is that many viral infections are more severe in aged individuals (Chen and Subbarao, 2007; Assiri et al., 2013; Saad et al., 2014; Alsolamy, 2015) . Agedependent changes in susceptibility are especially striking in patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), both caused by coronaviruses (SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV). In the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, all patients under 24 yr of age survived, whereas 6, 15, and >50% of patients aged 25-44, 45-64, and >65 yr of age, respectively, succumbed to the infection, with many developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (Donnelly et al., 2003; Nicholls et al., 2003; Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . This marked age-dependent increase in mortality is also observed in mice and nonhuman primates infected with SARS-CoV (Nagata et al., 2008; Day et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2010; Frieman et al., 2012) . For example, 6-10-wk-old C57BL/6 mice are highly resistant to SARS-CoV and remain asymptomatic even in the absence of interferon signaling (Frieman et al., 2010) , whereas as mice age from for maintaining lung homeostasis and for prostaglandin production, we initially examined CD11c + cells harvested from young and middle-aged mice for global changes in gene expression. Expression levels of 186 genes changed during aging, with many involved in antigen presentation and inflammation ( Fig. 1 B and Table S1 ). Many of these were predicted to contribute to a chronic inflammatory response. However, our previous study showed that levels of a prostaglandin with antiinflammatory properties, PGD 2 , were elevated in aged mice (confirmed in Fig. 1 A) and contributed to poor outcomes after SARS-CoV infection (Zhao et al., 2011) . Therefore, we next focused on genes involved in the AA pathway, including several phospholipases, cyclooxygenases, and synthases, which could modulate PGD 2 levels in the lungs. Of all the genes in the AA cascade, only levels of secreted phospholipase A 2 group IID (PLA 2 G2D) were significantly higher in CD11c + cells in the lungs of middle-aged compared with young mice (using twofold differences as a cutoff; Fig. 1 , C and D). We confirmed these results by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses of CD11c + cell RNA by separating CD11c + and CD11c \\ue032 cells from the lungs of naive young and middle-aged mice using magnetic beads and quantifying the expression of PLA 2 G2D mRNA (Fig. 2 A) . We observed 25-30 fold higher expression of PLA 2 G2D mRNA in lung CD11c + compared with CD11c \\ue032 cells from middle-aged mice. Comparison of CD11c + cells from young and middle-aged mice revealed that PLA 2 G2D was expressed at levels >50-fold higher in middleaged mice (Fig. 2 A) . Flow cytometric analysis also showed higher expression of PLA 2 G2D in CD11c + compared with CD11c \\ue032 cells on a per cell basis in both young and middle-aged mice, as measured by mean fluorescent intensity (MFI; Fig. 2 B ). In addition, middle-aged mice harbored a higher frequency of CD11c + cells expressing PLA 2 G2D compared with young mice (Fig. 2 C) .'}, {'text': 'Cathepsins are a group of proteolytic enzymes, classically lysosomal in origin, that vary in class, pH optimum, target specificity, inhibition and function. They are nearly universally expressed by eukaryotic organisms, in which they regulate a range of physiological processes, befitting their varied attributes and target preferences [1] . A subset of these proteases-the cysteinyl cathepsins-was characterized originally as being lysosomal in location and function. Later work uncovered additional roles in intracellular and extracellular locations [2] . Some of these enzymes cleave specific substrates involved in antigen presentation, collagen turnover in bone and cartilage, processing of endogenous bioactive peptides, and leukocyte penetration of cellular monolayers and matrix [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The widely expressed cysteine protease cathepsin L (CTSL) is implicated in several types of pathology and is a potential pharmaceutical target for inhibition to control inflammation and counterproductive immune responses. For example, by cleaving viral proteins, CTSL helps Ebola, Hendra and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) viruses infect host cells, thereby advancing these infections [6] [7] [8] . On the other hand, in epithelial cells of the thymic cortex, CTSL plays a key role in removing the placeholder class II-associated invariant chain peptide, which is important for positive selection of CD4+ T cells that bind to MHC proteins on other cells. This role in T cell maturation can influence MHCrestricted presentation of and response to extracellular antigens, such as those from bacteria [9] .'}, {'text': 'Current evidence suggests that when Adv5 is used in gene therapy or vaccination, the innate immune responses are responsible for its dose-limiting toxicity and that the adaptive immune responses, which eliminate the infected cells, limit the duration of transgene expression 25 . We found that the Rag2 −/− mice displayed significantly higher levels of the cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ after Adv5 inoculation than the immunocompetent mice. Positive correlations between viral immunopathology and TNF-α or IFN-γ levels have also been reported in clinical cases and animal models of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H5N1 infection 26, 27 . This release or synthesis of TNF, in turn, plays a major causative role in the pathological changes associated with IV adenovirus infusion as well as a role in the induction of the antiviral immune response 28, 29 . The IFN-γ produced by T and NK cells plays an important role in cell-mediated immunity against a broad spectrum of intracellular pathogens, and it also activates antigen presentation and primes TNF-α release by macrophages 30 . The inflammation associated with a cytokine storm has been shown to begin at a local site and to spread throughout the body via the systemic circulation 31 . Therefore, we speculate that the brain pathology in the immunodeficient mice was not a direct toxic effect of adenovector delivery, but more likely a secondary effect of inflammation and the immune response to the adenovector, because TNF-α and IFN-γ are considered the key cytokines that drive pro-inflammatory activity 32 .'}, {'text': 'Regions with higher plant and animal biodiversity are often accompanied by an increased range and abundance of vector-borne or nonvector-borne diseases. (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) Accordingly, the inhabitants of these areas should be able to tolerate an increased number of unfamiliar microorganisms. We speculated that the subjects who demonstrate direct and strong immune responses may die of a cytokine storm in fulminant hepatitis, severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, and other infections. (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) This concept is supported by a lower mortality rate from influenza H1N1 in Asia than in Australia, New Zealand, and North America. (35) Cytokine storm was first described in graft-versushost disease and was soon also identified in many infectious diseases (36) ; many cytokines, chemokines, and complements are involved. (37) (38) (39) The immunerelated SNPs selected in this study that included IFN (IFNL4), tumor necrosis factor-receptor (CD40), and complements (CFB) are all participants in cytokine storms. HLA class II molecules are associated with antigen presentation and are also modulated by cytokines. (40) A cytokine storm is considered to be a hyperreaction of the immune response to a pathogen that may cause fulminant disease and mortality. (36) (37) (38) (39) When humans migrate to a new territory, they face many unfamiliar pathogens. Those subjects with a strong immune response will die of disease, but those subjects with a weak immune response to the pathogens may survive. Chronic HBV infection with an immune tolerance stage is an example of a weak immune response. (3) (4) (5) East Asian populations carry similar allele types of HBV-related SNPs (Fig. 2B) , although the environments of northern China and Japan differ substantially from those of southern China and the Indo-China Peninsula. (41) We therefore propose that there was a significant physical block to gene flow on the Indo-China Peninsula. Most of the survivors in East Asia exhibit delayed HBV-related immune clearance genotypes. This could have been a survival strategy to pass through the Indo-China Peninsula and southern China during human migration. Such HLA class II genotypes are aimed toward an immune tolerance strategy. (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) These changes were successful because this group of people spread to northern China and Japan and have become the largest population in the world numerically. However, such a survival benefit may have been a trade-off with cold tolerance as these populations were unable to cross the Bering Strait in large numbers. Indigenous Americans do not show the same HBV-related allele pattern; they have a low prevalence of chronic HBV infection and high influenzarelated mortality rates. (1, 2, 35) Overall, we identified two genetic adaptations that occurred during human migration. The first was the decreased expression of immune-related genes after leaving Africa; the second was the evolution of an HLA system with migration into the Indo-China Peninsula. Both events may have aimed to decrease the strength of the immune response and avoid cytokine storms when facing different types of pathogens. The high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in East Asia could be a consequence of such a strategy. However, persistent HBV infection-related HLA genotypes are not present in the African population (Fig. 2B) and cannot be responsible for the high prevalence of HBsAg in Africa.'}, {'text': 'Convergent evolution dictates that diverse groups of viruses will target both similar and distinct host pathways to manipulate the immune response and improve infection. In this study, we sought to leverage this uneven viral antagonism to identify critical host factors that govern disease outcome.

Categorizing by function, we observed downregulation of gene expression associated with antigen presentation following both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Further examination revealed global down-regulation of antigen-presentation gene expression, which was confirmed by proteomics for both H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, epigenetic analysis suggested that DNA methylation, rather than histone modification, plays a crucial role in MERS-CoV-mediated antagonism of antigenpresentation gene expression; in contrast, H5N1-VN1203 likely utilizes a combination of epigenetic mechanisms to target antigen presentation. Together, the results indicate a common mechanism utilized by H5N1-VN1203 and MERS-CoV to modulate antigen presentation and the host adaptive immune response.'}, {'text': 'MBL interacts with several, but not all, viruses in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner. It interacts with several strains of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) via its spatially conserved, high mannose-type, N-linked glycosylated gp120 envelope glycoprotein [38] . While HIV-1 uses several mechanisms to evade adaptive immune responses-such as \"glycan shielding\" in which gp120 glycosylation site mutations prevent neutralising antibody binding but maintain cell receptor binding [39] -MBL is able to bind and neutralise diverse strains of HIV-1. However, MBL does not neutralise HIV-1 through complement activation, even at concentrations far exceeding physiological serum levels [40, 41] . Therefore, MBL directly neutralises infection in complement-independent manners, such as opsonisation to enhance phagocytosis by DCs and macrophages, as observed for bacterial infections ( Figure 4 ) [42] . The phagocyte cell surface receptor for MBL has not yet been identified, but a likely candidate is calreticulin-a protein-folding chaperone typically situated in the ER, with roles in antigen presentation-which may bind the MBL at the MASP-binding site [43] . MBL-gp120 interaction also prevents HIV-1 interaction with cell entry inhibitors and inhibits trans-infection by direct spatial blocking [40, 44] . The same viral glycoprotein-mediated complement-dependent/independent mechanisms are employed by MBL to neutralise influenza A virus (IAV) [45, 46] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [47] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [48, 49] , Dengue virus (DV) and West Nile virus (WNV) [50, 51] infection in vitro. Furthermore, MBL can indirectly activate coagulation upon pathogen binding, perhaps via MASP-1 recruitment, as observed in HCV [52] and IAV [45] infection.'}, {'text': 'Because HPV infects the epithelium of the lower female genital tract, where it can lead to cervical carcinoma [16] , one strategy against cervical cancer might be to induce effective mucosal immunity with an aim toward inhibiting genital HPV transmission/infection and eradicating HPV-infected cells. Several studies have demonstrated that oral immunization with viral antigens can induce antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Oral administration is not only the way to increase mucosal immunity, but it is generally more convenient than parenteral administration. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which are relatively safe and exhibit an adjuvant effect in modulating the immune responses, may be a good delivery vehicle for mucosal immunization [22] [23] [24] . In addition, surface-displayed antigens on lactobacilli were reportedly efficient for inducing antigen presentation in dendritic cells [23] , and surface localization of HPV16 antigens on lactococci was reported to induce greater cellular immunity compared to the intracellular or secreted forms [25] . Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that oral administration of viral antigens displayed on Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus S protein and the HPV16 E7 protein, effectively induces antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies [18] and antitumor responses in mice [19] . In this study, we used the pgsA gene product, a transmembrane protein derived from the polyc-glutamic acid synthetase complex (the Pgs-BCA system) of Bacillus subtilis [26, 27] , as a surface anchoring motif for surface display of antigens on L. casei. Here, we examined whether oral administration of E6 antigens expressed on L. casei could elicit E6-specific cellular immunity. The induction of effective immunity was assessed by production of antigen-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA, and by quantification of antigen-specific IFN-c-secreting CD8 ? cells in splenocytes or local lymphocytes by the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. Finally, we tested the in vivo tumor regression effect of HPV16 E6-expressing L. casei in a mouse tumor model seeded with the E6-expressing tumor cell line (TC-1).'}, {'text': \"Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded positivesense RNA viruses with genomes of 25-32 kb, and the group includes the biggest known genomes among the RNA viruses [1, 2] , which infect and cause disease in a wide variety of species, including bats, birds, cats, dogs, pigs, mice, horses, whales and humans. Five types of coronaviruses are found to be circulating the human population [3] . A second coronavirus known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been recognized as the causal organism of a highly lethal pneumonia in patients in the Middle East and in travellers from this region about 10 years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome became epidemic [4] . The virus MERS-CoV belongs to the genus betacoronavirus [5] which is also known as novel coronavirus (nCoV). After the first report of causing human infection was published in September 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations Emergency Committee denied the fact that MERS-CoV did not meet the criteria of becoming ''public health emergency of global concern'' in July 2013. Nevertheless it was termed ''serious and great concern'' and was also reported as a threat to the entire world. In June, 2012, for the first time virus was identified in a patient who died in Saudi Arabia after developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunctional syndrome (MODS) [6] . In same year, the first MERS disease broke out has been reported [7] . Although the name suggests that it is limited to the Middle East, the death scenario has been also reported in France, UK, Italy and Tunisia [8] . The symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Although MERS-CoV patients have primarily had respiratory disease, a number of secondary complications have also been informed, including acute renal failure, multi-organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and consumptive coagulopathy. In addition, many patients have also reported gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea [7] . As mentioned earlier, this virus has the capacity to transmit from human to human. It was also shown that MERS-CoV was capable of infecting bats and porcine cell lines in addition to human cells. These possessions would indicate a low barrier for transmission between hosts [9] [10] [11] . Recently, dipeptydyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of primary human bronchial epithelial cells and huh-7 cells are identified as the receptor of MERS-CoV virus entry. After entering into the cell, the virus specially modulates the innate immune response, antigen presentation and mitogen-activated protein kinase. The genome structure of MERS-CoV is similar to other coronaviruses, with the 5 0 two-thirds of the genome encoding the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) required for viral genome replication, the remaining 3 0 third of the genome encoding the structural genes that make up the virion (spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins) and four accessory genes intermingled within the structural gene region. The viral genome expression starts with the translation of two large replicative polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b, which are encoded by the viral replicase gene that compromises ORF 1a and 1b. This replicase complex not only mediates genome replication but also causes transcription of nested set of subgenomic mRNA responsible for structural proteins [12, 13] . After transcribing pp1a, -1 ribosomal frame shifting is occurred to transcribe pp1b which is subsequently cleaved into 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins [12] . The downstream region of ORF1b is characterized by containing a variable number of smaller genes, always including those encoding the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins. These genes are translated from subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that form a 5 0 and 3 0 co-terminal nested set with the viral genome. Subgenomic mRNAs are composed of a common 5 0 leader sequence that is identical to the genomic 5 0 region and a variable part of the 3 0 quarter of the genome, with different sg mRNAs making different ORFs available for translation. The complement of the leader and ''body'' segments of the sg mRNAs are assumed to be joined during discontinuous negative-strand RNA synthesis. This step produces the templates for sg mRNA synthesis and is directed by a base-pairing interaction between conserved transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) [14] [15] [16] . Such TRSs are found at the 3 0 end of the leader sequence (leader TRS) and at different positions upstream of genes in the genomic 3 0 proximal domain (body TRSs). The synthesis of subgenome-length negativestranded RNAs is directed by the complement of a body TRS at the 3 0 end of a nascent minus-strand base pairing with the leader TRS, with the extent of sequence complementarity being an important determinant of the level at which a given sg mRNA is produced [13] . In this study, two types of gene silencing techniques were implemented computationally, siRNA and miRNA. siRNA also called silencing RNA is generally a double-stranded RNA and contains 21 base pairs in length. The central role of siRNA is posttranscriptional gene silencing by interfering with the protein, and their basic mechanism is to bind and promote the degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) at specific sequences [17] . An effective siRNA has to contain some basic features like A/U at the 5 0 end of the antisense strand, G/C at the 5 0 end of the sense strand, at least 5 A/U residues in the 5 0 terminal end or one third of the antisense strand and absence of any GC stretch of more than 9 nucleotide in length. If designed siRNA fails to fulfill above criteria, then gene silencing is not possible by that particular siRNA [18] . Each siRNA strand contains a 5 0 phosphate group and a 3 0 hydroxyl (OH) group, produced from dsRNA or hairpin looped RNA. By using nanoparticles like polyethyleneimine and other approaches, siRNA can be introduced into the cell for specific knockdown of a gene of interest, after entering into the cell siRNA cleaved by an enzyme called dicer (RNase III-like enzyme). Then the siRNA incorporated with multi-subunit protein complex called RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC seeks out the correct target mRNA, and then siRNA unwinds and is believed. After this process, the antisense strand directs degradation of the complementary strand of appropriate mRNA using different kinds of endo and exogenous enzymes [19] . siRNA may also be used for therapeutic purpose like vaccine, and their efficacy can be ensured to more than 75 % to knockout or kill any targeted gene or protein [20] . Mature miRNA regulates diverse cellular processes in plant and animal species through the assembly of miRNA-induced RISC complex which binds to the complementary targets in the cellular mRNA and subsequently cleaves or transcriptionally represses the mRNA depending on the complementarity. In addition, recent studies suggest that miRNA also play a role in the regulation of viral infection [21] . Therefore, in the present study an effort has been made to identify potential siRNA and miRNA molecules for silencing of ORF1ab coding mRNA or gene in MERS-CoV using computational approach.\"}, {'text': 'Pulling together the threats, concerns and caveats discussed, it is clear that many hurdles would be overcome if it were possible to move into a new age of high-technology vaccines. The requirements would need to encompass safety, strong potency, but with safe adjuvants such that effective titers could be generated without the need for multiple boosts over long periods, and the incorporation of multiple epitope strings such that defence against several pathogens could be incorporated into a single construct. It is possible that a live vaccine vector could be used to deliver a number of heterologous antigens to achieve multivalent vaccines, or a collection of subunit proteins in an appropriate delivery system could be used to achieve multivalency. An alternative scenario is that such a vaccine construct may need to take the form of a DNA vaccine and that the selected epitopes in the string would need to be selected for antigen presentation and potency across the widest possible range of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-presenting alleles [9] . Although many trials have been undertaken to investigate the immunologic potency of such vaccines in a wide range of disease settings, the field is still in its infancy. A major step was recently taken towards the creation of such vaccines with the establishment, through the NIAID, of an Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource [2] . However, a number of experimental studies have already been undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of DNA vaccines against biowarfare pathogens. These approaches have included incorporation of anthrax sequences into DNA vaccines, DNA cocktails incorporating both anthrax and plague antigens, or incorporation of anthrax sequences into adenovirus-based vaccine constructs [11] [12] [13] . Each approach has given a high degree of protection in animal models. The development of effective DNA vaccination regimens, coupled with the acquisition of a large database of information on presented epitopes from bioterrorism pathogens, suggests that it may indeed be possible in the near future to progress towards a generation of vaccines that are potent, safe and widely protective.

Despite the high resemblance between MERS and SARS, the case-fatality rate of MERS is >30%, which is 3 times than that of SARS [4] [5] [6] . Moreover, severe lymphopenia, which is an important prognostic factor for SARS, is commonly observed in patients with MERS [7, 8] . The high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV is partly explained by the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is abundantly found in most host cells [9, 10] . In in vitro and ex vivo studies, MERS-CoV exhibits broad tissue tropism that is unparalleled by other coronaviruses [11] [12] [13] [14] . Upon entry, MERS-CoV efficiently evades the host innate immune response by the viral accessory proteins 4a, 4b, and 5, by papain-like protease, and by membrane (M) protein, which are potent interferon antagonists, and by downregulating the expression of genes within the antigen presentation pathway [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Moreover, we have previously demonstrated that MERS-CoV causes productive infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs), the key professional antigen-presenting cells, which may facilitate systemic virus dissemination [14, 22] . Finally, MERS-CoV induces an aberrant cytokine/chemokine response that may be responsible for the cytokine dysregulation in severe MERS cases [14, 22, 23] .'}, {'text': 'Along with β-sheets, α-helices are the most common secondary structures adopted by polypeptides. Hydrogen bonding between the backbone amide oxygens and the N-H bond 4 residues away induces a right-handed helical structure in which the amino acid sidechains are directed away from the core. Further stabilisation can be achieved through the subsequent assembly of multiple peptides to form coiled-coil motifs, whereby multiple helices wrap around each other into a superhelical bundle. 466 Assembly is driven first by the exclusion of hydrophobic residues form the aqueous exterior, and then stabilised and enhanced by inter-strand electrostatic interactions between polar and charged amino acids. 467 The resultant assemblies offer a powerful means to produce complex bioactive materials that have found use across a range of disciplines. 466, [468] [469] [470] Coiled-coil peptides were first used in the nanotechnology field by Stevens et al to drive the assembly of AuNPs into higher order aggregates. 471 The formation and application of NPs composed entirely of coiled-coil peptide structures was subsequently driven by the group of Burkhard. In 2006 they reported the rational structure-based design of a linear peptide, composed of the pentameric repeat forming coiledcoil domain of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) 472 , and a de novo designed peptide that formed a self-assembled trimer. This peptide was able to undergo self-assembly into regular, polyhedral NPs, and display multiple copies of a bioactive species on the particle surface. 473 As described in section 7, such a display is capable of effectively mimicking pathogen antigen presentation. Coiled-coil NPs have subsequently therefore been demonstrated to act as novel immunogens for the production of vaccines, for diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 474 malaria, 475 and HIV 476, 477 (Figure 20) . Further developments which enhance NP stability, including the addition of lipid tails, 477, 478 and the formation of elastin-like peptide hybrids (as discussed below), 327 have additionally been reported, bringing CACs into the low nM range. Importantly, the coiled-coil core has been shown to only be weakly immunogenic itself.

A subset of these enzymes (the cysteinyl cathepsins) was characterized originally as lysosomal in location and function (1) . Later work uncovered additional roles in extracellular spaces as well as in the cytosol and nuclei, revealing that cathepsins are not limited to the unspecific destruction of proteins delivered to lysosomes (2) . Rather, some cathepsins process specific substrates important to activities such as antigen presentation, collagen turnover in bone and cartilage, neuropeptide and hormone processing, and leukocyte penetration of the extracellular matrix and cellular monolayers (1, (3) (4) (5) . The loss of activity among specific cathepsins in mice or humans produces a variety of phenotypes (1, 2, 6) . The widely expressed cysteine protease cathepsin L (Ctsl) is implicated in several types of pathology, and is a proposed target for therapeutic inhibition to control inflammatory and immune responses (5, 7, 8) . For example, by cleaving fusion proteins, Ctsl helps Ebola, Hendra, and severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses to enter cells, thereby advancing these infections (9) (10) (11) (12) .

This FBP binds and competes the substrate ParvB away from degradation, apparently creating a permissive cellular environment (16) . Human adenovirus creates two E3 ligase proteins that cause degradation of the p53 protein, allowing production of viral proteins and genetic material without p53-mediated host cell apoptosis (17) .

This route has a number of advantages, such as the high permeability of the nasal epithelium, which allows a higher molecular mass cut-off for permeation of approximately 1,000 Da, as well as the rapid drug absorption rate. Accurate and repeated dispensing of vaccine, mucociliary clearance, presence of peptidases, proteases and nuclease enzymes in the mucus or associated with nasal membrane, variation in extent of absorption with the mucus secretion and mucus turnover and deposition of the formulated vaccine to all areas of the nasal mucosa (especially lymphoid tissues), potential of uptake of vaccine formulations by the primary olfactory nerves in the nasal cavity, local irritation and unpleasant taste from concentrated drug reaching the mouth are major challenges associated with intranasal delivery of vaccines (Oliveira et al. 2007; Sharma et al. 2009 ). These problems can be overcome by design of appropriate antigen carriers. Nanocarriers for nasal vaccines are able to facilitate the transport of the associated antigen across the nasal epithelium, thus leading to efficient antigen presentation to the immune system and provide the protection and stability of encapsulated genetic materials (Koping-Hoggard et al. 2005) . Further, use of mucoadhesive agents offers a strategy for the facilitation of increased residence time and increased vaccine efficacy (Alpar et al. 2005) . Polycarbophil (PC) or polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based in-situ mucoadhesive polymers have demonstrated better nasal absorption of plasmid DNA (Park et al. 2002) .

Further, several modification on the chitosan polymers have also been made to improve the potential of chitosan nanoparticles for nasal administration of DNA vaccines like preparation of low molecular weight chitosan, development of water soluble chitosan (N-trimethyl chitosan), etc. Blends of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) have exhibited the capacity to associate and release plasmid DNA in a controlled manner. Results showed that DNA-loaded nanoparticles elicit significantly pronounced immune response compared to the naked plasmid DNA for up to 6 weeks (Csaba et al. 2006) .

Needle-free nasal immunization, using nanoemulsion is made of soya bean oil, alcohol, water and detergents emulsified into droplets of 40 nm, has been reported to be a safe and effective hepatitis B vaccine (Makidon et al. 2008) . The release of liquid or particles into the airflow enters one nostril via a sealing nozzle and exits through the other nostril and minimizes the risk and problems related to deposition of particles in the lung, which occurs during conventional inhalation from a nebulizer and increases the delivery of particles to the posterior part of the nasal mucosa.

The antigen presentation is key for activation of T cell and produces chemokines and cytokines that regulate disease progression (Seder et al. 2008) . The immune evasion of novel coronavirus targets APC and suppresses T cell activation. Dendritic cell immunisation activates T cells. As a result, the production of IFNgamma, IL-2 and TNF-alfa are released (Zhao et al. 2010) . Therefore, the viral titre gets reduced as immunisation with Dendritic cells (DC) by T cell activation successfully suppressed viral pathogenesis. It can be characterised as a potent immunogen to activate immune response.'}, {'text': 'In this report, we analyse the ability of a H5 DNA vaccine to prime the neutralising antibody response elicited by an MIV H5N1 (Indo) boost. These regimens were safe and well tolerated, adding to the growing body of data that DNA vaccines carry a favourable safety profi le. The safety data from the assessments of this H5 DNA vaccine are consistent with previous data generated by the Vaccine Research Centre using the same platform to assess vaccines for HIV, Ebola, Marburg, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and seasonal infl uenza, in which 2100 individuals have been immunised with a total of 5700 doses of DNA vaccines. 17, 18, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] We have shown that the length of the interval between priming and boosting signifi cantly aff ects the magnitude and breadth of the response and that DNA priming increases the potency of the responses. In some individuals, DNA priming can also increase breadth by eliciting antibodies directed to a highly conserved structure in the haemagglutinin stem. 11,31 DNA priming followed by MIV with a 24-week boost interval induced HAI titres more than four times higher than did two doses of MIV. Similar to other H5 antigens, this antigen generally induces low-titre and low-frequency HAI responses compared with seasonal infl uenza strain vaccine antigens. The DNA vaccine assessed in this study has previously been shown to induce an HAI titre of 1:40 or more in just 20% of individuals when given three times at a 4 mg dose without an inactivated vaccine boost. 32 Similarly, when given twice, the MIV boost product assessed in this study was recently shown by another group 33 to induce an HAI GMT of 27·6, and, although a 6-month boost interval improved those responses slightly (GMT 58·7), little or no cross-reactive antibody was induced. 33 In the data from two clinical studies reported here, when a single DNA prime was boosted by MIV at 24 weeks, protective (≥1/40) HAI titres were induced in 81% of individuals with a GMT of 152 (groups 3 and B), which is a frequency and magnitude much greater than those previously induced by either vaccine alone. MIV given twice induced a protective HAI titre in six of 15 individuals in group 1, and in four of nine in group A. This fi nding is remarkable because of the relatively weak immunogenicity of the H5 antigen and because only one dose of DNA priming was needed to greatly improve the antibody response. Moreover, the longer boost interval signifi cantly improved the responses seen in the DNA primed groups, but did not signifi cantly improve the responses in individuals who received two doses of MIV. This result indicates that the biology of the priming immunisation diff ers between DNA and a traditional inactivated vaccine. Another surprising fi nding was that two doses of DNA as a prime did not greatly improve the overall responses beyond those seen with a single-dose of DNA. The two-dose DNA prime did aff ect the ELISA and neutralising antibody response but had no signifi cant eff ect on the HAI response, which is known to correlate with protection. Gene-based antigen delivery accesses diff erent pathways of antigen presentation and might thereby facilitate T-cell help, increase the number and diversity of CD4 clones, 34 and induce greater expansion of the relevant B-cell populations. DNA prime-inactivated vaccine boost has been shown to elicit higher haemagglutinin-specifi c T-cell responses compared with inactivated vaccine alone in animals, supporting the fi ndings in this study.'}, {'text': 'The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against pathogens [1] . Early recognition and uptake of microbes by host professional phagocytes, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are crucial for downstream immune responses and pathogen clearance. Phagocytic cells express a range of cellular receptors, known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), involved in the sensing of microorganisms [1] . These proteins bind to conserved microbial ligands, promoting phagocytosis and antigen presentation, and trigger intracellular signaling and cytokine secretion. The quality of this initial pathogen recognition can have important consequences in both the outcome of infection and the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Two particular PRRs of the C-type lectin receptor family-dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin related (L-SIGN, also known as DC-SIGNR)-have recently been the focus of considerable attention [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . These two lectins, which can act as both cell adhesion receptors and pathogen recognition receptors, are encoded by two genes located on chromosome 19p13.2-3 within a ϳ26 kb segment [7, 8] . DC-SIGN and L-SIGN exhibit high nucleotide (73%) and aminoacid (77%) identity, and identical exon-intron organization [8] . An additional characteristic of both lectins is the presence of a neck region, made up of primarily 7 highly conserved 23 amino acid repeats, that separates the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) involved in pathogen binding from the transmembrane region. In regard to expression profiles, DC-SIGN is expressed mainly on endocytic cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas L-SIGN is expressed on endothelial cells in liver and lymph nodes, and in cells lining placental capillaries [9 -11] . DC-SIGN and L-SIGN share the ability to bind high-mannose oligosaccharides through their CRD, and have been shown to recognize a vast range of microbes, such as HIV-1, Ebola, Hepatitis-C virus, severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARS)-coV, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [12, 13] .'}, {'text': 'The list of differentially expressed genes and fold changes was submitted for Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA).

Human CD23 (FCER2) is a low affinity IgE receptor that plays an important role in cell-cell adhesions, B cells survival and antigen presentation [3] . Human DC-SIGN (hDC-SIGN, CD209) was initially identified as an ICAM-3 binding protein mediating dendritic cells (DCs) and T cell interaction, an ICAM-2 binding protein regulating chemokineinduced trafficking of DCs across both resting and activated endothelium, and a HIV-1 gp120 receptor mediating transmission of HIV-1 to susceptible cells in trans [4] [5] [6] . The second hDC-SIGN homologue, hL-SIGN (CD209L), was subsequently shown to have Developmental and Comparative Immunology 33 (2009) 747-760 similar but subtly distinct property of pathogen recognition to hDC-SIGN [7] . Both hDC-SIGN and hL-SIGN bind to asparagineslinked high-mannose glycans present on a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses [8] . Human CLEC4G (hCLEC4G, previously named LSECtin), co-expressed with hL-SIGN on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSECs), is the third hDC-SIGNrelated CLR recently identified [9, 10] . hCLEC4G was found to interact with the surface glycoproteins of Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [11] . However, unlike hDC-SIGN and hL-SIGN, the hCLEC4G selectively binds to glycoproteins terminating in a disaccharide, GlcNAcb1-2Man, resulting in its interacting with truncated glycans on glycoprotein of Ebola virus [12] . Since these four CLRs form a tight gene cluster and share overall protein domain structure, similar genomic organization and possible analogous function, it has been proposed that they are derived from a common ancestor [9] .'}, {'text': 'Virus infection is the first step in pathogenesis; TGEV can infect porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) (Laude et al., 1984) . Here, we demonstrated that virulent TGEV could also infect immature Mo-DCs at low levels. It is well known that a common escape mechanism for viruses infecting DCs is to interfere with their maturation process. DC maturation is regarded a pivotal process for the cells to present viral antigens to activate T cells and initiate antiviral immune responses. LPS acts as a DC maturation stimulus in culture, increasing the expression of MHC-II, MHC-I, CD1a, CD80 and CD86, enhancing antigen presentation, and inducing IL-12 production (Langenkamp et al., 2000) . As expected, our work found that LPS also stimulated the maturation of immature Mo-DCs. However, virulent SHXB inhibited the maturation of immature Mo-DCs through a reduction of CD1a, CD80/86 and SLA-II-DR, and UV-SHXB stimulated their expression. Our findings are similar to reports stating that influenza A virus (IAV) reduced the amount of CD11c, CD172a, CD1w and CCR5 on DCs (Boliar and Chambers, 2010) , while inactivated influenza virus was able to improve the expression of these proteins on DCs (Garulli et al., 2013) . Therefore, some structural proteins may play an important role in inducing the maturation of immature Mo-DCs, and some non-structural proteins produced by the TGEV RNA transcription may play an important role in inhibiting the maturation of these immature cells. It is known that viral RNA and some structural proteins, such as spike and membrane, are natural PAMPs that can activate Mo-DCs, while non-structural proteins 3a, 3b and 7 determine the virulence of TGEV. Reports have demonstrated that a deletion of the non-structural protein 3 gene resulted in slightly reduced pathogenicity in vivo , and removal of non-structural protein 7 promoted an intensified dsRNA-activated host antiviral response (Cruz et al., 2011) . The exact reasons for the inhibition of maturation of these immature Mo-DCs are still not completely understood. Virulent SHXB and UV-SHXB infection could not induce the apoptosis of Mo-DCs at 24 h p.i., which suggests that the down-regulation of surface markers on the Mo-DCs was not caused by apoptosis. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARSV) also did not up-regulate the expression of CD83, CD86, MHC-I and MHC-II on adult immature DCs, and did not induce apoptosis of adult immature DCs (Law et al., 2005) .'}, {'text': 'Dendritic cells (DCs) are extremely important antigen presenting cells that are critical to the initiation of both the adaptive and innate immune response of the host, and it is clear that their interactions with pathogens can have both positive and negative effects on pathogenesis (Liu, 2001; Mellman and Steinman, 2001) . Coronaviruses gain entry into the host via respiratory or intestinal epithelium where there are numerous DCs. APN/CD13 is expressed by specific DC subsets and is important in maturation of DCs, extracellular degradation of antigens, and may be involved in T-cell activation (Amoscato et al., 1998; Liu, 2001; Summers et al., 2001; Woodhead et al., 2000) . Consequently, we studied mAPN and hAPN expression on dendritic cells derived from the bone marrow (BM-DCs) of non-transgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice. Expressions of surface proteins including MHC I, CEACAM1a, mouse APN, and CD11c were very similar in both the nontransgenic and the hAPN-transgenic mice. In contrast, hAPN was only expressed by the DC-enriched population derived from the hAPN-transgenic mice. BM-DCs isolated from the hAPN-transgenic mice were susceptible to HCoV-229E, whereas BM-DCs derived from non-transgenic mice were not. Our data demonstrate that DCs from hAPNtransgenic mice are infected by HCoV-229E in a receptordependent fashion, and Thiel et al. have shown that HCoV-229E virus-like particles transduce human DCs (Thiel et al., 2003) . Therefore, DCs in the human respiratory epithelium may play a role in the initiation of HCoV-229E infection and its dissemination to other tissues. Other group 1 coronaviruses that infect cats and pigs may also infect DCs via their cognate APN receptors (Delmas et al., 1992; Tresnan et al., 1996) . Mouse DCs are also infected by mouse hepatitis virus-A59, a group 2 coronavirus, in a CEACAM1a receptor-dependent manner (Turner et al., 2004) . DC-coronavirus interaction may be a common evolutionary mechanism of entry, dissemination, immunomodulation, and pathogenesis observed in diverse coronaviruses, including feline infectious peritonitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and HCoV-229E Jeffers et al., 2004; Konikova et al., 1998; Thiel et al., 2003; Turner et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004) . In other viruses, such as LCMV and measles, infection of DCs leads to severe immunomodulation, impairment of antigen presentation, and cytokine expression (Borrow et al., 1995; Hahm et al., 2004; Naniche and Oldstone, 2000) . The hAPN-transgenic mice developed in this study will provide an excellent reproducible source of hAPN-expressing mouse DCs to study the effect HCoV-229E infection has on DC function.'}, {'text': 'In this study, acid-degradable cationic nanoparticles have been used to deliver a model antigen, ovalbumin, to BMDCs. More evidence has been accumulated indicating that DCs play pivotal roles in orchestrating immune responses: activation and tolerance [25, 26] . DCs reside in antigen-encountering areas, such as under the skin and the mucosal layer. After antigen uptake and maturation, DCs migrate to lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes and activate naïve T and B cells by very efficiently presenting antigen-derived peptides with costimula- tory molecules, resulting in the secretion of cytokines at high concentrations upon activation [27, 28] . DCs are also more susceptible than other cells to viral infections like human inmmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus so that viral antigens are presented efficiently [29, 30] . It has also been shown that DCs link innate immunity with adaptive immunity. Therefore, it is a general consensus that the targeting and priming of DCs is a critical target for the development of a successful vaccine strategy. It was demonstrated that acid-degradable nanoparticles are significantly more effective in antigen presentation by MHC I than non-degradable nanoparticles (Fig. 4) . A possible explanation for this finding is that more proteins are released into cytoplasmic space with the acid-degradable particles than is the case with the non-degradable ones. It was previously hypothesized that release of the small molecule aldehyde after hydrolysis might destabilize the lysosomal membrane due to increased osmotic pressure [12] , followed by cytosolic release of the antigen. In addition, the swelling effect of the hydrogel nanoparticles resulting from the cross-linker cleavage may also contribute to the more facile release as swelling could lead to a leaky lysosomal membrane structure. However, more studies must be undertaken to clarify the cellular behavior of aciddegradable particles since there is still a dearth of supporting evidence for endosomal (or lysosomal) escape of extracellular molecules. For example, it was believed that a polycationic polymer (e.g., PEI) aided in endosomal escape by the proton sponge effect. However, this theory was recently criticized by some studies with various protonated groups indicating no difference in endosomal escape [31, 32] . As shown in Fig. 8 , the degradability of the particles favors distribution of the antigenic payload throughout the cytoplasmic space, thereby contributing to more efficient presentation of antigenderived peptides through DC maturation. Another possible explanation of the enhanced antigen presentation is the protection of proteins from lysosomal degradation in the encapsulated microenvironment of the nanoparticles, slowing or even negating the effect of proteases and minimizing exposure to the degrading conditions of the lysosome as a result of fast release into the cytoplasm. Therefore, more proteins would be successfully processed in the cytoplasm and presented on MHC I molecules.'}, {'text': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the investigation of the SARS-CoV immunity has garnered significant attention since the worldwide outbreak spreaded to 30 countries in 2003 [1] [2] [3] . The SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus encoding four major structural proteins, known as a spike glycoprotein (S), a small envelope protein (E), an integral membrane glycoprotein (M), and a nucleocapsid RNA-binding protein (N) [4] . Upon viral infection, the viral proteins expressed within the infected cells are degraded in the cytosol by proteasomes. Peptides generated by the proteasomes are transported by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where an ER aminopeptidase produces the mature MHC class I-peptide complex by trimming the peptide to eight or nine amino acids [5] . The resulting MHC class I-peptide complex expressed on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, plays important roles in the activation of specific cytotoxic T-cells for infected cell killing. On the other hand, the MHC class I-peptide complexes expressed on the virus infected cells is a \"marker\" for being killed. Therefore, formation of stable MHC class I-peptide complexes is critical to elicit cytotoxic T-cell response to eliminate the infected cells. Immunogenicity of a peptide sequence for the cytotoxic T-cell is determined by its binding affinity towards the human MHC class I molecule and its availability upon proteasome digestion of the parental protein. Subunit vaccines containing HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides is highly effective for the induction of strong cytotoxic T-cell response against infectious virus [6] . Among the four structure proteins of the SARS-CoV, the S and N proteins are the major targets for vaccine research studies due to their potency in triggering immune responses [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The S protein contains 1256 amino acids and is involved in viral entry through 0264-410X/$ -see front matter © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on host cell surface [15, 16] and the N protein contains 422 amino acids and is involved in the viral RNA packaging [17, 18] . Previous studies suggested that HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS S and N protein peptides can trigger specific human cytotoxic Tcell response against SARS in vitro [12, 14] . In the present study, we have identified a noval HLA-A*0201 restricted Nprotein peptide (N220: LALLLLDRL). The binding affinity of the N220 peptide towards human MHC class I molecule is comparable to the N223 peptide and is higher than the N227 and N317 peptides previously described [12] . Moreover, in order to stablize the MHC class I-peptide complex for antigen presentation, the N220 sequence was genetically linked to the cDNA of human ␤ 2 -microglobulin and the alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains of the human MHC class I heavy chain to form a single-chain-trimer (SCT) in our DNA vaccine design. The SCT approach makes the MHC class I molecules less dependent on chaperone assistance for peptide loading and hence a stable MHC class I-peptide complex for antigen presentation is produced [19] [20] [21] . The potency of the N220 DNA vaccine to trigger cytotoxic T-cell response against N-protein expressing cells was demonstrated in a HLA-A2.1K b transgenic mouse model and our results indicated that the SARS protein N220 peptide is a good vaccine candidate for SARS vaccine development.'}, {'text': 'Natural infection with EBV induces a neutralizing antibody response in the majority of individuals, although the titers are generally modest (IC 50 z10 1.5 ) (Sashihara et al., 2009) . The quality of the immune response is often a key determinant of vaccineinduced immunity independent of its magnitude. It is noteworthy that the soluble gp350 ectodomain and D 123 do not effectively induce neutralizing antibodies in mice, unlike the D 123 nanoparticles, despite the fact that both soluble and nanoparticle forms of gp350 have similar antigenic profiles. This observation highlights the importance of antigen presentation, specifically the conformational authenticity of functional domains, in determining the quality of the immune response (McLellan, 2013) . Immune focusing through nanoparticle presentation of selective domains of gp350 enabled elicitation of antibody predominantly to CR2BS, providing a mechanism of potent neutralization in sera. The mode of neutralization targeting the receptor-binding site (RBS) has been described in other viruses. The VRC01class of antibodies that bind the CD4-binding site of the envelope of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) potently neutralize >90% of circulating viral strains regardless of their sequence variability Zhou et al., 2010) . MAbs CH65 (Whittle et al., 2011) , C05 , and some others neutralize influenza A viruses through the conserved sialic acid-binding site on a viral hemagglutinin. Certain mAbs to hepatitis C virus (Krey et al., 2013) , poliovirus (Chen et al., 2011 (Chen et al., , 2013 , herpes simplex virus (Lee et al., 2013) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (van den Brink et al., 2005) also use a similar mechanism to neutralize viruses. Since the RBS must be functionally conserved to engage its host cell receptor, it is one of the most vulnerable targets of the virus. However, isolated RBS-containing domains (or RBDs) are often weakly immunogenic due to steric hindrance from surrounding glycans, hypervariability near the RBS that impairs targeting by (B) Plasma gp350 binding antibody titer in immunized monkeys after three immunizations.

NECs are local, and their numbers in the mucosa far outnumber those of local dendritic cells, making their ability to present allergen and activate T cells an important asset in the first line of defense (Fig 2, F and G) . Increased expression of MHC class II in murine type II alveolar ECs has been demonstrated after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, further supporting the importance of NECs in the microbial response. 5 Several viruses, such as human coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome, have evolved mechanisms to inhibit MHC class II pathways in ECs. 6 Bet v 1 pollen allergen has further been demonstrated to bind and enter ECs within minutes after exposure in patients with AR, even during the nonsymptomatic winter season. 7 In summary, for the first time, we have demonstrated the role of antigen-presenting NECs in patients with allergic airway disease. Previous information in the field is scarce, even though it has been shown that intestinal ECs can stimulate CD4 1 T cells in vitro to proliferate and secrete cytokines. 1 Furthermore, the importance of a local rapid response that enables antigen presentation and CD4 1 T-cell activation was recently demonstrated in an mouse inflammatory bowel disease model in which MHC class II-deficient mice were unable to induce and reinstate tolerance when fed with Helicobacter hepaticus and IL-10 receptor-blocking antibodies. 8 We demonstrated that MHC class II in NECs can be loaded with exogenous antigens (Fig 2, A and B , and see Video E1), that NECs stimulate allergen-specific CD4 1 T-cell responses in mice and human subjects (Figs 1 and 2), and that HNECs from patients with AR can amplify the allergic response contributing to the ongoing allergic CD4 1 T cell-mediated inflammation, with the latter likely contributing to the high number of activated CD4 1 T cells found in nasal mucosa of patients with AR. 9 Hence this is the first time that local immune activity within the nasal mucosa has been directly linked to a rapid and efficient allergen-induced T-cell activation.'}, {'text': 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a member of the bacterial Mycobacteriaceae family and is known to cause tuberculosis (TB) in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported the death of 1.7 million M. tuberculosis-infected persons in 2016 and estimated 10.4 million new cases of tuberculosis patients per year worldwide. 1,2 Emergence of multidrug-resistant strains makes the situation more ominous. 1 Therefore, to develop alternative treatments against both drugsusceptible and multidrug-resistant strains, discovery of novel and highly conserved drug targets is warranted. G-quadruplex-forming nucleic acid motifs are one of the most studied evolutionarily conserved drug targets and are copiously found in critical regions of genomes of various organisms ranging from eukaryotes to prokaryotes and viruses. 3, 4 In humans, G-quadruplexes have been found to be associated with the regulation of vital cellular processes such as replication, recombination, transcription, and translation. 5 In addition to the telomere, G-quadruplexes have also been identified in the promoter regions of various proto-oncogenes, such as KRAS, Bcl-2, c-Kit, PDGF-A, c-MYC, VEGF, and c-Myb, and are considered as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. 6-10 Recently, various viruses such as HIV, Ebola virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Zika virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were also reported to harbor conserved G-quadruplex structures in the coding region of various structural and non-structural proteins. 11 In all these cases, G-quadruplexes either play a regulatory role in replication, transcription, and packaging of the viral genome or help the viruses in immune evasion. 11 Among the vast kingdom of prokaryotes, only a few pathogenic bacteria have been explored for the presence of G-quadruplex sequences in their genome such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Deinococcus radiodurans. 12, 13 Conserved G-quadruplexes are shown to be responsible for antigenic variations in Neisseria gonorrhoeae 14 and Treponema pallidium. 15 Previously, several strain-specific G-quadruplexes were also reported in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv strain). 16, 17 Therefore, here in the present study, we sought to explore novel and highly conserved putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences in all 160 available and completely sequenced strains of M. tuberculosis. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of highly conserved potential G-quadruplex motifs (PGQs) in three essential genes of M. tuberculosis, namely, espK, espB, and cyp51 that were responsible for the virulence of bacteria inside the host cell. Insights into pathogenic mechanisms of M. tuberculosis infection indicate that it is a facultative intracellular human pathogen and survives in the host environment by preventing the maturation of phagosomes into phagolysosomes. 18, 19 Previously, the M. tuberculosis genome has been revealed to possess an extended region of difference 1 (extRD1) locus that harbors genes for early secretory antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) system 1 (ESX-1) secretion machinery, a type VII secretion system (T7SS). 20 This T7SS utilizes EspK (encoded by Rv3879) for secreting ESAT-6 and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) as a dimer ( Figure S1A ). After secretion, the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 dimer complex enters into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of macrophages and sequesters Beta-2-Microglobulin (b2M) protein, an essential component of MHC class I system. 21 This sequestration reduces MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation, an innate immune response of the host cell. 21 In addition to ESAT-6 and CFP-10, ESX-1 also secretes another ESX-substrate protein, EspB. EspB interacts with the C-terminal region of EspK protein and directly portrays an inhibitory role in the maturation of phagosome. 18, 20 Upon EspKassisted secretion of EspB outside the cytosol by ESX-1 secretion machinery ( Figure S1A ), EspB undergoes oligomerization, binds to phospholipids of host macrophages, and initiates a membranolytic or pore-forming phenomenon inside the phagosome that serves as a crucial initial step of immune evasion for bacteria. 22 Thus, secretion of EspB helps the bacteria in suppressing the innate immune response of the host cell and promotes its survival within the host 20 (Figure S1A ). Above insights into ESX-1 secretion machinery revealed the crucial role of EspB and EspK proteins in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis within the host and suggested that inhibition of espK and espB expression could lead to a synergistic reduction in M. tuberculosis virulence and pathogenesis, and thus represents a novel therapeutic approach. The cyp51 gene is another PGQ-possessing gene that has been previously reported to be involved in sterol biosynthesis pathway and membrane formation. [23] [24] [25] [26] Because our bioinformatics analysis revealed the PGQs in the espk, espB, and cyp51 genes, in the present work, we sought to investigate the regulatory role of these PGQs on the expression of PGQ-possessing genes. To accomplish this, we used various biophysical and biochemical techniques, and confirmed the formation of G-quadruplex structures by predicted PGQs. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism (CD) melting analysis allowed us to demonstrate the affinity of TMPyP4 to PGQs. Next, polymerase stop assay and qRT-PCR assay of RNA from a M. tuberculosis culture treated with TMPyP4 confirmed the downregulation of all PGQs possessing genes espK, espB, and cyp51. Therefore, this study demonstrates a novel approach for developing active therapeutics against M. tuberculosis infection by exploiting PGQ targets ( Figure S1B ).'}]\n"

The top annotations were dominated by skin, vascular, renal, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric diseases as well as by DNA metabolism, amyloids, meiosis, and transcription pathways. In addition, many prevalent diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, and allergy, and infectious diseases as well as some severe conditions, such as oncologic and severe acute respiratory syndrome, were also significantly enriched (q value < 0.05).

The IEDB provides several tools to predict peptide binding to MHC class I molecules, and these were recently compared to the large set of tools that are available elsewhere on the internet 27 . Such a large-scale comparison is meant to inform tool users of the current state of the art. For tool developers, this comparison provides a set of benchmark data with which to evaluate newly developed tools against, and it instructs them on which approaches have proven to be successful. In combination with predicting the ability of a particular peptide sequence to bind MHC class I molecules, predictions of its processing by the proteasome and transport by the transporter associated with antigen processing are also made available. These can be used to further narrow the set of candidate T-cell epitopes from a protein sequence. There is an ongoing formal evaluation of these tools that takes advantage of the data collected in the IEDB, as well as an evaluation of MHC-class-II-binding predictions. In addition to evaluations of existing servers, we also plan to hold prediction contests in which interested scientists can submit their predictions for a set of targets. Such contests have had a tremendous positive impact in the evaluation and prediction of protein structure 28 . Figure 1 | Generating a formal ontology for the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). The initial ontology of the IEDB described all elements of the database as classes with associated characteristics (left panel shows this for the immunogen class). In the development process towards a formal ontology, these elements are placed in a hierarchy (simplified view depicted on the right), in which relationships between the different classes are made explicit. For example, the previously separate and unconnected classes Antigen, Immunogen and Adjuvant are now recognized as being objects (for example, Proteins), which participate in a certain role (as Immunogens) in a specific process (such as Immunization). Compared with the T-cell-epitope predictions, the state of antibody-epitope predictions is widely considered to be suboptimal 29 . In a recent workshop sponsored by the NIAID that brought together many experts from the antibody-epitope-prediction community, this concern was widely shared, and the steps needed to improve this situation were discussed 30 . There was wide agreement that the field could greatly benefit from community-assembled datasets that clarify what types of epitope should be included in an evaluation and that this should be dependent on the intended use of a prediction. Similarly, the metrics used to quantify the success of predictions should be commonly agreed on for a better comparison between different studies. This effort to establish community-accepted datasets and metrics will aid in the acceptance of a newly emerging second generation of antibody-epitope prediction tools, many of which take advantage of the three-dimensional structures that are available for antibody-antigen binding. Three steps in an advanced query for B-cell epitopes are illustrated. First, criteria are specified to query for epitopes that are recognized in mice, where the immunogen applied was the epitope source species and the species is selected to be severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (a). On submitting this query, a summary of epitope records matching these criteria are displayed (b). This includes information on the curated reference, epitope structure, epitope source, and assay used. When choosing the 'Details' link for a specific epitope, the complete curated information is displayed (c). \"}, {'text': 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread rapidly across China. As of 7 March 2020, the infection was reported from 97 countries globally. To date, 103 882 patients have been confirmed to have COVID-19, of whom 3522 have died [1] . Recently, many trials have been designed to determine an effective therapeutic regimen for COVID-19. Of the target regimens, chloroquine therapy is being considered [2] . Several clinical trials in China have shown chloroquine phosphate, an aminoquinoline used in malaria treatment, to be effective against COVID-19 at a dose of 500 mg/day [3] . Chloroquine phosphate also played a promising role in the management of the Zika virus and SARS-CoV outbreaks. Chloroquine acts by increasing the pH of intracellular vacuoles and altering protein degradation pathways through acidic hydrolases in the lysosomes, macromolecule synthesis in the endosomes, and post-translational protein modification in the Golgi apparatus. In macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells, chloroquine interferes with antigen processing, thereby achieving an antirheumatic response [4] . Studies have demonstrated that chloroquine also confers its considerable broad-spectrum antiviral * Corresponding author. effects via interfering with the fusion process of these viruses by decreasing the pH. In addition, chloroquine alters the glycosylation of the cellular receptors of coronaviruses [5] . Hydroxychloroquine ( Fig. 1 ) , a less toxic aminoquinoline, has an N -hydroxyethyl side chain in place of the N -diethyl group of chloroquine. This modification makes hydroxychloroquine more soluble than chloroquine. Similar to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine increases the pH and confers antiviral effects. In addition, hydroxychloroquine has a modulating effect on activated immune cells, downregulates the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and TLR-mediated signal transduction, and decreases the production of interleukin-6 [6] . Although the antimalarial activity of hydroxychloroquine is equivalent to that of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine is preferred over chloroquine owing to its lower ocular toxicity [7] . Retinopathy is a dose-limiting adverse effect of hydroxychloroquine, and a safe daily dose appears to correspond to 6.5 mg/kg of ideal body weight and 5.0 mg/kg of actual body weight [8] . Although there are more clinical data on the anti-coronaviral activity of chloroquine than that of hydroxychloroquine, both of these agents are theoretically similar in their antiviral activity [9] . Moreover, chloroquine is not as widely available as hydroxychloroquine in some countries. In addition, chloroquine is associated with greater adverse effects than hydroxychloroquine. For example, in patients with COVID-19, chloroquine can interact with lopinavir/ritonavir, resulting in prolongation of the QT interval. Hence, it is necessary to consider hydroxychloroquine instead of chloroquine when the latter is not available for treating patients with COVID-19. For example, in Iran, there is a serious shortage of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can be recommended instead. Other therapeutic agents for COVID-19, such as antiviral agents (oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, etc.), interferons and intravenous immunoglobulins that do not interfere with hydroxychloroquine, are currently under investigation.'}, {'text': 'Recently, interest in influenza vaccination strategies aiming at the induction of cross-protective immune response against heterosubtypic virus strains has revived. These strategies target activation of cross-protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses directed against conserved viral proteins, i.e. nucleoprotein (NP) . In this respect whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccine can be considered a good vaccine candidate. Stimulation of MHC class I-restricted CTL activity by non-infectious vaccines, such as WIV, could be achieved through cross-presentation by dendritic cells (DCs). This process involves endocytosis of antigen, processing of antigen by cytosolic proteasomes and transportation through the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into MHC class I-loading compartments. Due to the fusogenic capacity of the virus, delivery of the nucleocapsid (and NP), into the cytosol is an active process mediated by the virus itself. Since virus inactivation protocols used to produce WIV vaccine can compromise viral fusion activity, they potentially could diminish WIV immunogenicity in terms of CTL induction. We therefore investigated to what extent fusion activity contributes to cross-presentation using untreated and 0.5% formaldehyde (FA) treated WIV as a model for fusion active and inactive particles, respectively. We found that fusion inactivation did not reduce in vitro maturation of bone marrow-derived DCs in response to WIV uptake nor upregulation of IL-12 gene expression and IL-12p70 production. Fusion inactivation of WIV did not reduce MHC class I-restricted presentation of a NP-derived epitope to previously primed CTLs in vitro. However, fusion activity played a significant role in priming of NP-specific CTLs in vivo, as demonstrated by in vivo cytotoxicity assay. From these data we conclude that fusion activity of WIV is beneficial in priming of CTL in unprimed individuals (the very young), but does not contribute to boosting of CTL responses in individuals primed for influenza by infection earlier in life (adolescent, adults, the elderly). Rapid induction of type I interferon (IFN) expression is a central event in the establishment of the innate immune response against viral infection, and requires the activation of multiple transcriptional proteins following engagement and signaling through Toll-like receptor-dependent and -independent pathways. Many viruses therefore encode factors that subvert the IFN system to enhance their virulence. Most viruses belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae encode nonstructural proteins to subvert this innate immune response. For this purpose viruses belonging to the subfamily paramyxovirinae use proteins encoded by alternative reading frames within the phospoprotein (P) gene. Members of the subfamily pneumovirinae (such as RSV) use the NS1 and NS2 proteins as antagonistic proteins. The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a causative agent of severe respiratory tract illness, and belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae, subfamily pneumovirinae. HMPV does not encode a P gene with alternative reading frames or proteins related to the NS1 and NS2 of RSV. So far, little is known about the interaction between hMPV and the innate immune system. We demonstrate that hMPV blocks the IFN production pathway at early time points after infection. Upon infection of A549 cells with the prototype strain (hMPV NL/1/00) transcripts for the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA-5, as well as transcripts for the IFN genes were not up regulated. In addition, the virus did not induce translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus, and the virus was able to block IRF3 translocation induced by Sendai virus infections. Thus, like other paramyxoviruses , hMPV counteracts the innate immune system at early stages after infection, however hMPV must use a novel mechanism to do so. The type III interferon (IFN) family (IFN-k1, 2, and 3) elicits an antiviral response that is nearly identical to that evoked by IFN-a/b, but these cytokines signal through a receptor that displays a more tissue-specific distribution in vivo. The rapid non-cytolytic IFN-a/b-mediated inhibition of virus replication is particularly important in the central nervous system (CNS), where virus-or immune-mediated destruction of infected neurons is detrimental to the host. However, not much is known regarding the antiviral activity of IFN-k in the brain. Although IFN-k has little antiviral activity against certain mouse pathogens in the brain, human neurons have been reported to be capable of both producing and responding to this cytokine. We found that intranasal or intracranial infection of mice with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induced IFN-k2 mRNA expression in the brain, and that human IFN-k1 and k2 mRNA expression were induced by VSV infection in cultured primary human brain cells. Although the relative magnitude of IFN-k induction was substantial, its expression level was still nevertheless low on an absolute basis. In addition, we found that IFN-k induced the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in multiple human CNS cell types, including primary neurons, astrocytes, and choroid plexus epithelial and endothelial cells. However, the magnitude of ISG expression induced by IFN-k was lower than that activated by IFN-a, and as a consequence, provided a lower level of protection against subsequent virus challenge. These results show that while IFN-k may provide some protection against virus infection in human brain cells, it appears to play a minor role compared to IFN-a/b. These studies also further support the idea that due to its modest activity in the brain, therapeutic use of IFN-k for chronic HCV infection may cause fewer of the neurological side effects that are associated with IFN-a therapy. The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is likely mediated by disproportional immune responses and the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity. Although, SARS-CoV is able to block the production of type I interferons (IFNs) in most cell types, human plamacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) have been shown to produce IFNa upon SARS-CoV infection. In contrast, little is known about type I IFN production in SARS-CoV infected mice. In vivo a modest upregulation of IFNb mRNA but no induction of IFNa is observed in BALB/c mice. To examine the IFN response after SARS-CoV infection in mice, murine pDCs derived from BALB/c and BL6 mice were infected with SARS-CoV after which IFN responses were analyzed using RT-PCR and ELISA. The mRNA levels for IFNa, IFNb and IFNk were upregulated 10-100 times in SARS-CoV infected pDCs, suggesting a potent IFN response in these cells. At the protein level, however, only IFNa could be detected after SARS-CoV infection. Similar results were obtained with heat inactivated SARS-CoV and influenza virus. In contrast, the specific pDC stimulator CpG-ODN induced IFNa, IFNb and IFNk both at the mRNA level and at the protein level, showing that these cells are capable of producing these different IFN proteins. Interestingly, pDCs derived from BL6 mice infected with SARS-CoV produced more IFNa protein than pDCs from BALB/c mice, consistent with higher IFNa mRNA levels. This study shows that murine pDCs are able to produce IFNa after SARS-CoV infection but the production of IFNb and IFNk seems to be blocked at the translational level. The tight regulation of IFN production in pDCs with respect to IFN subtypes and genetic background may be important in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. The immediate-early phase of the host innate response to viral infection is initiated through pathogen recognition and expression of early protective genes such as type I interferon (IFN). Here, we performed a genome-scale RNA interference screen to identify positive and negative regulators of the innate response to Sendai virus infection. In a primary screen, an individually arrayed library of lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting 16,000 human genes was used to knock down each gene (in pools of 3 shRNA per gene) of a 293T cell line stably expressing the luciferase gene under the control of the IFN-b promoter. Using the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) as a ranking metric, we selected 600 candidate genes (300 positive and 300 negative regulators) whose silencing significantly modulated the reporter activity. This cell-based assay was validated by identifying known positive regulators such as IRF3, MAVS, c-Rel, RelA/p65 and IKKb. Bioinformatics analysis of gene ontology (GO) biological process and molecular function categories identified significantly enriched terms, such as eight members of the IjB kinase/NF-jB cascade among 300 positive regulators, representing a fold enrichment of 3.7 (P = 0.006). All candidate genes are being re-confirmed and tested in secondary screens using individual shRNA-expressing lentiviruses (minimum of 5 shRNA per gene) to minimize the selection of potential off-target hits. The secondary screens were designed to define the step in which newly identified regulators are positioned in the antiviral signaling cascade. The approach described in this study will provide significant insight for novel regulators of the host innate response to viral infection. Data from primary and secondary screens will be presented. The Type I IFN subtypes are often relatively species selective, which makes crossspecies experiments difficult to interpret. The Syrian golden hamster and Norwegian rat are common rodent models, and two macaques, rhesus and cynomolgus, are common non-human primate models for a variety of viral infections. The alpha interferon subtypes from these species are mostly unavailable and hence either mouse or human IFN subtypes will frequently be used in these model systems. In order to understand which mouse or human alpha IFN subtypes could be used in cross-species experiments, we have established antiviral cytopathic effect inhibition assays on rhesus macaque (LLC-MK2/VSV), cynomolgus macaque (JTC-12/EMCV), Syrian golden hamster (BHK-21/VSV) and norwegian rat (C6/VSV) cell lines. All 14 mouse alpha IFNs were tested on the hamster and rat cells and all 12 of the human subtypes were tested on the rhesus and cynomolgus cell lines. In general, most of the mouse IFN-alpha subtypes exhibited activity on the other rodent cells and most of the human IFN-alpha subtypes displayed activity on the macaque cells. However, there are several notable exceptions with certain subtypes having little of no activity in the cross-species assay. The results of this study may be used to identify and select IFN-alpha subtypes that can be best used in the relevant animal model system.'}, {'text': 'Our study is particularly interesting when compared to the closely related MV infection in humans. This disease is associated with an extensive lymphopenia with up to 90% of the lymphocytes disappearing from the peripheral blood. Numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, B cells, neutrophils and monocytes are reduced leading to a temporary, MV-associated immunosuppression rendering humans highly susceptible to opportunistic infections (Okada et al., 2000; Niewiesk et al., 2000; Naniche et al., 2000; Nanan et al., 1999) . The mechanisms of MV-induced immune suppression are still not fully understood and are most likely multifactorial (Marttila et al., 2001) . It has been discussed that MV suppresses cell-mediated immunity by interfering with the survival and functions of dendritic cells and T cells (Fugier-Vivier et al., 1997) . Cell membrane-associated MV components inhibit antigen processing (Marttila et al., 2001) . It has been speculated that the production of a soluble factor can inhibit antigen-specific T cell proliferation and the proliferation of uninfected B cells (Fujinami et al., 1998) . However, the mechanism of MV induced lymphopenia is unknown. During natural infection the preferential target cells infected are monocytes and not lymphocytes (Nanan et al., 1999) , corresponding to the results obtained in the present study with CDV. In Measles, the number of MV-infected cells remains a minor population, and therefore cytolysis of viralinfected lymphocytes alone cannot explain the profound immune suppression. In the acute phases of CDV-induced lymphopenia this also appears to be the case. With Measles, it has been suggested that lymphopenia is primarily due to extended death of non-infected blood cells caused by apoptosis (Okada et al., 2000) . This again is related to the observation made in the present study with CDV. In the acute phase of many other virus infections a lymphopenia with characteristics as those presented here can be observed (Oldstone, 1996) . Examples include classical swine fever (Summerfield et al., 1998 , bovine viral diarrhea (Ridpath et al., 2000) , porcine Circovirus-2 infection (Nielsen et al., 2003) , influenza (Tumpey et al., 2000) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Peiris et al., 2003) , foot and mouth disease (Bautista et al., 2003) , Dengue virus infection (Fadilah et al., 1999) , cytomegalovirus infection (Einsele et al., 1993) , and many others. Interestingly, in many cases a correlation of disease severeness and degree of lymphocyte depletion was observed. Based on this, the determination of lymphocyte numbers can have a prognostic value for the development of the disease. The mechanism of this lymphocyte depletion in the acute phase of virus infections is unknown. A nonspecific (over-)activation of the innate immune system to a rapidly replicating virus in a naïve host might be involved. The effects could be mediated by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and interferons, which in turn affect lymphocyte homeostasis.'}, {'text': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the investigation of the SARS-CoV immunity has garnered significant attention since the worldwide outbreak spreaded to 30 countries in 2003 [1] [2] [3] . The SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus encoding four major structural proteins, known as a spike glycoprotein (S), a small envelope protein (E), an integral membrane glycoprotein (M), and a nucleocapsid RNA-binding protein (N) [4] . Upon viral infection, the viral proteins expressed within the infected cells are degraded in the cytosol by proteasomes. Peptides generated by the proteasomes are transported by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where an ER aminopeptidase produces the mature MHC class I-peptide complex by trimming the peptide to eight or nine amino acids [5] . The resulting MHC class I-peptide complex expressed on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, plays important roles in the activation of specific cytotoxic T-cells for infected cell killing. On the other hand, the MHC class I-peptide complexes expressed on the virus infected cells is a \"marker\" for being killed. Therefore, formation of stable MHC class I-peptide complexes is critical to elicit cytotoxic T-cell response to eliminate the infected cells. Immunogenicity of a peptide sequence for the cytotoxic T-cell is determined by its binding affinity towards the human MHC class I molecule and its availability upon proteasome digestion of the parental protein. Subunit vaccines containing HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides is highly effective for the induction of strong cytotoxic T-cell response against infectious virus [6] . Among the four structure proteins of the SARS-CoV, the S and N proteins are the major targets for vaccine research studies due to their potency in triggering immune responses [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The S protein contains 1256 amino acids and is involved in viral entry through 0264-410X/$ -see front matter © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies suggested that HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS S and N protein peptides can trigger specific human cytotoxic Tcell response against SARS in vitro [12, 14] . In the present study, we have identified a noval HLA-A*0201 restricted Nprotein peptide (N220: LALLLLDRL). The binding affinity of the N220 peptide towards human MHC class I molecule is comparable to the N223 peptide and is higher than the N227 and N317 peptides previously described [12] . Moreover, in order to stablize the MHC class I-peptide complex for antigen presentation, the N220 sequence was genetically linked to the cDNA of human ␤ 2 -microglobulin and the alpha-1 and alpha-2 domains of the human MHC class I heavy chain to form a single-chain-trimer (SCT) in our DNA vaccine design. The SCT approach makes the MHC class I molecules less dependent on chaperone assistance for peptide loading and hence a stable MHC class I-peptide complex for antigen presentation is produced [19] [20] [21] . The potency of the N220 DNA vaccine to trigger cytotoxic T-cell response against N-protein expressing cells was demonstrated in a HLA-A2.1K b transgenic mouse model and our results indicated that the SARS protein N220 peptide is a good vaccine candidate for SARS vaccine development.'}]\n"

Neutrophils store PTX3 in secondary granules and upon appropriate stimulation promptly release it. In a simplistic view, PTX3 plays a crucial 2 BioMed Research International role in inflammation through activation of the complement cascade and inhibition of P-selectin-mediated neutrophils extravasation. Since PTX3, an acute-phase protein rapidly produced by vascular tissues as well as by cells of innate immunity in response to inflammation, is a rapid and reliable marker for primary local activation of innate immunity and inflammation in several disorders, including acute kidney injury, severe acute respiratory syndrome or LPS-induced lung injury, atherosclerosis, and acute myocardial infarction [for more detail, see review [6] ].'}, {'text': 'Primary pulmonary infections were the most common cause of PARDS in the PARDIE study, underlying two-thirds of the cases of PARDS identified.

Much attention has been paid to pandemic viruses that can lead to drastic increases in ARDS patients: influenza, including H1N1; Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [43] . Interestingly, the extreme virulence of these coronavirus infections is now thought to be immune mediated, with very early and exaggerated activation of the complement cascade [44] . More commonly, viral etiologies are those that cause the upper respiratory infections and bronchiolitis cases commonly encountered in the pediatric intensive care unit: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus [43, 45] .

In addition, PTX3 binds key elements of the complement cascade and modulates complement activation [62] . By interacting with C1q through its globular head, PTX3 modulates the classical pathway of complement. PTX3 interacts with the members of the lectin pathway ficolin-1, ficolin-2 and MBL and synergistically amplifies a complement-mediated innate response to Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans [63] . As CRP and SAP, PTX3 also interacts with FH and C4BP [62] on the cell surface or in ECM, thus preventing alternative pathway-mediated exaggerated complement activation. This mechanism is of particular interest in cancer, where the interaction of PTX3 with FH is determinant in regulating complement-dependent tumorpromoting inflammation [50] .

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an emerging infectious disease with severe mortality, affected many countries in 2003 and the coronavirus is the etiologic agent (Peiris et al., 2003) . In terms of pathogenesis of SARS, viral load in the first phase may in turn result in host inflammatory response during the second phase. The SARS complications are associated with severe inflammatory tissue destruction due to excessive activation of the innate immune system and a notable proportion of the patients progressed to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in the later phase of viral infection (Li et al., 2003) . Considerable clinical and experimental evidence implicated that complement appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of these late post-viral complications, which could even be predicted by increased complement activations (Sahu and Lambris, 2000; Abe, 2006; Sarma et al., 2006) .

Ayurveda, as well as recent experimental results indicate the ingredients of a poly-herbo-mineral formulation KR as having anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory effects. It is substantiated by the clinical observations among tonsillitis patients. The key ingredients being the metallic Bhasmas (purified calx), like Swarna Bhasma, is prepared by incinerating gold processed with herbal preparations. 18, 19 Swarna Bhasma promotes immunity through phagocytosis. 20 Gold poly-herbal formulations are found to increases vitality and immunity. 21 The clinical applications of Swarna Bhasma and gold salts in Ayurveda are known for rejuvenation and immunomodulation for some chronic diseases. 22 Gold nanoparticles have significant applications in targeted drug delivery. 23, 24 Swarna Bhasma contains gold particles in the size range of nanoparticles. 25 Recent studies shows that Swarna Bhasma contained not only gold, but also several microelements (Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, Co, Mg, Ca, As, Pb, etc.). Animal model studies show Swarna Bhasma-treated animals significantly increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, which are responsible for reducing free radical concentrations in the body. 19 The antioxidant effect of Swarna Bhasma is considered to be one of the mechanisms for the immunomodulatory mode of action of the formulation.

Chemical modification of GL and GA has been tried, and a significant improvement in anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, and antiulcer activities was observed. These observations indicate immune-modulating and biological response modifier activities associated with GL. Tinospora cordifolia (TC) is known for its immunomodulatory and cytoprotective activities Quaternary alkaloids and biotherapeutic diterpene glucosides of TC (syringin, cordiol, cordioside, and coriofolioside) showed an immunopotentiating activity. Research work has been conducted on berberine, jatrorrhizine, tinosporaside, and columbin, which shows a possible mechanism of immunomodulatory activity as an activation of macrophages, leading to increases in granulocyteemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), leukocytosis, and improved neutrophil function. TC also inhibits C3 convertase of the classical complement pathway. Research on polysaccharide (a-D-glucan) derived from TC shows the activation of nuclear killer (NK) cells, complement system, and Th1 pathway cytokines, coupled with low nitric oxide synthesis. 43 Aswagandha has shown promising immunomodulatory effect in inflammatory experimental models. 44 Sunthi (Zingiber officinalis) has anti-inflammatory property which inhibits LPS-induced NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of the IkB-a, as well as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, and p38 MAPKs which were associated with a decrease in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxyenase-2 (COX-2). 45 Vacha (Acorus calamus) is reported for its inhibitory effect on mast cell-dependent anaphylactic reactions in allergic reactions of the respiratory tract. 46 Amla (Phyllanthus emblica) has been reported to suppress the expression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory genes (COX-2, iNOS, TNF-a, IL-16, and IL-6) in RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells in a dose-dependent manner. 47 Honey is known to enhance the action of these medicines, and has a potential immunomodulatory effect. 48e51'}, {'text': 'The root Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as liquorice, has been used since ancient times in Indian, Chinese, Egyptian, Greek and Roman medicine.

Some anti-complementary polysaccharides showed potent effects on complement-associated diseases in vivo 22, 23 . The presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prototypical endotoxin, in blood can cause the immediate activation of the complement cascade. We had reported that CHCP could ameliorate LPS-induced ALI in mice and reduce the complement activation products deposited in the lung tissue 20 . However, it is still unclear whether this effect was a direct result of CHCP\\'s anti-complementary activity in vivo. Herein, the beneficial effect of CHCP on ALI was further evaluated using a \"two-hit\" ALI rat model induced by hemorrhagic shock plus LPS instillation, which is more susceptive to lung injury 24 . Specifically, the in vivo anti-complementary activity of CHCP was also assessed.

These receptors trigger the transduction of different signals, leading to the induction of type I IFNs (including IFN-α and IFN-β family members) and proinflammatory cytokines. Type I IFNs activate the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway, and initiate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The products of these genes inhibit viral replication, eradicate virus-infected cells and facilitate the activation of antiviral adaptive immunity. 1, 2 TLRs and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) detect RNA virus infection. For example, TLR3 recognizes viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) released by infected cells and triggers TIRdomain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β-mediated signaling pathways, whereas TLR7 and TLR8 recognize viral single-stranded RNA and activate MyD88-dependent signaling. 3, 4 The RLRs, such as RIG-I and MDA5, recognize cytoplasmic viral RNA through their C-terminal RNA helicase domains, and then recruit the downstream adapter protein virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA, also known as MAVS, IPS-1 and Cardif) through their CARD domains. [5] [6] [7] [8] Both TLRand RLR-triggered signaling cascades activate the downstream kinases TBK1-IKKε and TAK1-IKKβ, leading to the activation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and NF-κB. These activated transcription factors collaboratively trigger the transcription of type I IFN genes. 9, 10 Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are intrinsic antiviral restriction factors. Like other intrinsic factors, the IFITMs can be further induced by IFNs. 11, 12 IFITM3, a member of the IFITM family, has been extensively studied 1 because it plays an important role in preventing endocytosed viral particles from accessing the host cytoplasm. Many viruses are inhibited by IFITM3, including Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Influenza A virus (IAV), flaviviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). [13] [14] [15] These are all enveloped viruses and enter the cell by endocytosis. It has been reported that IFITM3 restricts viruses independently of their receptor usage but is dependent on processes that occur in the endosome. It prevents membrane hemifusion mediated by envelope proteins of IAV and restricts the early steps of IAV replication. 16 It also restricts Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection by antagonizing the envelope glycoprotein. 17 IFITM3 restricts the entry of reoviruses, which are nonenveloped viruses, and utilizes endosome-dependent cell entry mechanisms. 14 Although the role of IFITM3 in antiviral immunity has been investigated intensively, here we report our novel observation that IFITM3 negatively regulates the virus-induced production of type I IFNs. Sendai virus (SeV), which fuses with the cell surface, is reportedly not restricted by IFITM3. 18 In this study, we demonstrate that IFITM3 negatively regulates SeV-induced production of type I IFNs by targeting IRF3. Thus, we report a distinctive mechanism of IFITM3 in antiviral immunity.'}, {'text': 'Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the second highly pathogenic coronavirus to emerge after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), causes severe acute respiratory failure and extra-pulmonary multi-organ damage accompanied by severe systemic inflammation [1] [2] [3] . However, the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV still needs to be explored. Complement activation and pyroptosis are two proteolytic cascades that defend the host against dangerous pathogens. They are important parts of the innate immune system and have some similar characteristics, including pore-formation and proinflammatory characteristics.'}, {'text': 'Respiratory pathogens, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), continue to have serious health and economic impacts on the poultry industry (Cavanagh 2003; Fang et al. 2007) despite the existence of vaccination programs. IBV is a coronavirus that causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease, and some strains can also cause nephritis. In addition, the reproductive tract of layer and breeder birds can be affected, causing decreased egg quality and production. As well as being an economically relevant pathogen in poultry, IBV also bears close resemblance to human coronaviruses, such as the pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Up to date, while much progress has been made in understanding the adaptive immune response to these respiratory pathogens (Ignjatovic and Galli 1995; Gelb et al. 2005) , the innate immune response remains poorly characterized. The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against an invading viral pathogen, and the outcome of an infection is dependent on the ability of host cells to recognize the invading pathogen and activate appropriate signaling pathways (Liao et al. 2011 ). If the innate immune response fails, pathogens are susceptible to triggering what is referred to as a cytokine storm (Tisoncik et al 2012) .

The response is induced by recognition of specific components of the infecting pathogenic microorganisms known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by special receptors (Garcia et al 2007; Takeuchi and Akira 2009; Liao et al 2011) . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the members of such receptors. To date, ten TLRs have been identified in chickens, namely TLR1-1 (TLR1A), TLR1-2 (TLR1B), TLR2-1 (TLR2A), TLR2-2 (TLR2B), TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR15, and TLR21. Interaction of TLRs with their specific ligands leads to an innate immune response, which leads to the expression and secretion of both pro-inflammatory cytokines and defensins as well (Abdel-Mageed et al. 2014) .'}, {'text': 'Innate defence strategies are designed to detect broad and conserved patterns which differ between pathogenic organisms and their multicellular hosts. This non-antigen-specific detection strategy is mediated by diverse and evolutionarily conserved families of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) 3 . An increasing number of PRRs are being identified, with the ten recently discovered members of the TLR family attracting the most interest at present. The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) which they recognize are structurally and chemically diverse compounds, but they share the common feature of being highly conserved in pathogens and absent from multicellular organisms 4, 5 . This broad recognition strategy allows the innate immune system to respond rapidly to infection in advance of the more delayed activation of antigenspecific immunity. As such, the key advantage of an integrated system of pattern recognition and antigenspecific responses is that the immune system divides the responsibility of recognizing and eliminating infectious agents by fulfilling two mutually exclusive goals of the primary immune response: speed and specificity 6 . It is important to note that the optimal immune response required for long-term protective immunityimmunological memory -represents the merger of these two competing goals and that vaccination exploits this union with remarkable success (FIG. 2) . of safer, better defined and more effective vaccines against a number of important diseases for which vaccines do not presently exist (for example, HIV, HCV, Neisseria meningitides and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)).

Changes in genes involved in other aspects of immunity, such as the complement system, have also been associated with recurrent viral upper respiratory tract infections, and they should not be overlooked [17] . Mannose-binding lectins are part of the innate immune system, binding pathogenassociated carbohydrates and activating the complement system through the classical pathway. Mutations within the MBL gene have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [18] . Susceptibility to the SARS coronavirus has been associated with changes in the 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) and myxovirus resistance 1 (MxA) genes as well [19] .

For example, in mice, development of chronic airway disease after infection with Sendai virus (SeV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome virus is mediated by alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) (7, 9) , and associations between the presence of AAMs and the incidence of COPD and asthma have been reported in humans (7, 10) .'}, {'text': 'The study of the relevance of polymorphisms of immunityrelated genes in infectious diseases has been an important area of investigation, especially with regard to how these polymorphisms influence both susceptibility to the infection and the course of disease development. Previously, we investigated Fc␥RIIA and MBL polymorphisms in a group of 180 people from Hong Kong who were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and revealed that in addition to age and comorbidity, Fc␥RIIA polymorphisms in individuals may influence outcome after infection with the SARS-CoV, the causative agent of SARS, as a significant association between Fc␥RIIA-R/R131 genotype and severe SARS was found (10) . It is important to investigate whether other host genetic factors could influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection and its subsequent clinical course. The innate immune system plays a role in limiting an infectious challenge in the early stages after exposure, during the lag time required to initiate long-lasting adaptive immunity. The impairment of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) due to polymorphisms of TLR genes can alter immune response to a wide variety of microbial ligands, including viruses, and polymorphisms in TLR2 and TLR4 have been linked to infectious diseases in human. In particular, TLR-Arg677Trp was reported to be present in Korean patients with lepromatous leprosy exclusively (6) , and this polymorphism was also found to be associated with tuberculosis in a Tunisian population (3). TLR2 and TLR4 SNPs also exhibit ethnic variation, with low and high frequencies in some Asian populations compared with Caucasians and Africans (7) . To examine the presence of polymorphisms in TLR2, TLR4, and their coreceptor CD14 in both healthy controls and SARS patients in Hong Kong, we further genotyped 152 patients who were diagnosed as having SARS both clinically and serologically in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong and a group of 198 blood donors from Hong Kong (10) for polymorphisms in TLR2, TLR4, and CD14.

Prx1 was secreted from lung cancer adenocarcinoma cells and was also detected in the serum of patients suffering from nonsmall cell lung cancer, as well as through specific antibodies against the peroxidase (112) . Prx2 was detected in plasma, potentially due to endogenous hemolysis or secretion by T cells, of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis with severe acute respiratory syndrome (118) . Prx1 and Prx2 are also known under the name ''natural killer cell enhancing factors A and B,'' because they increase the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells, which belong to the innate immune system (682, 683, 701) . Prx4 possesses a leader peptide and is processed and secreted from the cell via the ER and Golgi apparatus within minutes. The secreted form is potentially enzymatically active and might act in scavenging extracellular ROS or regulating biological processes via binding heparan sulfate attached to cell surfaces or the extracellular matrix (558) .

The function of one upregulated gene, TNFAIP3 (A20), is to downregulate the activity of IRF-3, a key transcription factor for induction of IFN (19, 38) . This pattern is in contrast to the mRNAs increased by in vitro MV infection of dendritic cells and PBMCs that were predominantly IFN and IFN-responsive genes (3, 50) . Likewise, PBMCs from influenza virus-infected humans and smallpox virus-infected monkeys showed significant upregulation of immune modulators induced by IFN (35, 36) . However, PBMCs from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome showed a similar pattern to measles with several upregulated genes from the innate immune system, but no IFN-induced genes (35) . This suggests that gene expression in PBMCs during the phase of measles studied reflects primarily the immune response to infection, not infection per se. Because measles is not recognized until the rash appears as virus clearance is initiated 10 to 14 days after infection, and changes in gene expression are rapid and tightly controlled (3, 4, 50) , it is possible that an IFN response would have been detected earlier in infection.'}, {'text': 'The interest in coronaviruses was reignited after the 2002 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2012 outbreak of MERS-CoV. Researchers have tried to understand pandemic potential of MERS-CoV by studying its emergence and ecology. Studies are being carrying out to assess how this virus causes disease so that novel therapeutics and vaccines can be developed. The mode of transmission of MERS-CoV is yet to be established, but it is assumed to have come from bats [13] . Camels found in the Arabian Peninsula may serve as intermediate hosts for human infection [14] . This review will focus on studies trying to elucidate mechanisms by which MERS-CoV escapes host-immune system and causes disease. We will also examine the recent advances in the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines. Figure 1 vitro studies. Studies were conducted on animal models and human lung cell lines, and the account from a single autopsy [43] . In vitro studies revealed that MERS-CoV can easily replicate in several cultured human cells, as well as, in the differentiated and nondifferentiated human epithelial cells [34, 44] . The antigens of MERS-CoV were found on the macrophages in the alveoli of the infected human lung explants, ciliated and nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells and pneumocytes [33, 45] . These findings were in sync with the findings made in the single autopsy where MERS-CoV antigen was detected on pneumocytes, endothelial cells and epithelial cells of the airways and few on macrophages [43, 45] . Macrophages are the important phagocytic cells of innate immune system which help remove the pathogenic substances from the body and present their antigens to the T cells. The cytokines as well as chemokines produced by the macrophages help in destroying the pathogens, adjusting the immune system and maintaining tissue homoeostasis [46] . However, in MERS, the virus-infected macrophages contribute considerably to the development of disease symptoms [47] . The infection with MERS-CoV of human epithelial cells induces the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines from the monocyte-derived macrophages. It is believed that these chemokines/cytokines cause inflammatory changes and tissue injury through infiltration of immune cells in the lower respiratory tract [47] . The patients suffering from MERS clinically manifest pneumonia, which is progressive in nature and has a large number of macrophages and neutrophils found in the fluids present in the lungs [3, 48] . Studies conducted on rhesus macaques have shown the lung tissue infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils on MERS-CoV infection, though their respiratory symptoms were milder as compared with humans [49] . Many scientists believe that this sequestration of immune cells contribute to the development of lymphopenia seen in patients with MERS. The progress in the severity of pneumonia and respiratory dysfunction in the MERS patients is also attributed to cytokine/chemokine induction [30, 50] . Zhou et al. found that MERS-CoV can efficiently replicate inside macrophages and, hence, can overcome the host immune system. [47] . Thus, these phagocytes act like reservoirs and means of transportation for these viruses, helping to replicate and disseminate, such as the HIV virus [51] .'}, {'text': 'H ypercytokinemia, the hallmark of cytokine release syndromes, is an excessive, uncontrolled release of proinflammatory mediators resulting in overwhelming systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure that, if left uncontrolled, can lead to death. 1 Originally described in graftversus-host disease, 2 hypercytokinemia has more recently been identified as a fundamental characteristic in immunopathologies of a variety of infectious diseases including primary influenza, 3 Ebola virus disease, 4 malaria, 5 and virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). 6 Hypercytokinemia can also be observed during sepsis, 7 and in primary (p) and secondary (s) HLH independently of the disease trigger. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] These diseases share clinical and laboratory manifestations including fever, malaise, organomegaly, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hyperferritinemia. 1 Hypercytokinemia, commonly referred to as a cytokine storm, is often consequent to an infectious trigger, presenting as an exaggerated activation of the innate immune system. 1, 13 Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a class of proteins that serve to trigger innate immune responses against numerous pathogens, are considered to be key instigators leading to hypercytokinemia. TLR4 signaling, for example, is thought to be important for the hypercytokinemia seen during gram-negative bacteria-induced sepsis. 14 In mice, repeated stimulation of TLR9, a receptor for unmethylated 5 0 -C-phosphate-G-3 0 (CpG) DNA of numerous bacteria and viruses, 15 leads to a cytokine storm that triggers clinical and laboratory features resembling HLH secondary to infections. 16, 17 Cytokines such as interferon g (IFNg), tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), interleukin-1 b, and interleukin-18 have been extensively studied in the context of clinical hypercytokinemia. [18] [19] [20] Of these, IFNg is considered to be the dominant cytokine affording biological effects on potentially all cells by virtue of the ubiquitous expression of the cognate receptor. 21 Produced by cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems, including natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T cells, T cells, neutrophils and dendritic cells, 16, 22, 23 IFNg is well place to serve as the instigating mediator of cytokine release syndromes. Indeed, substantially elevated levels of IFNg are measured in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 24, 25 and HLH, [26] [27] [28] both cytokine driven diseases. Furthermore, overexpression of IFNg in transgenic mice is sufficient to drive systemic and organ inflammation, 29 and in animal models of pHLH 30, 31 and sHLH, 16, 17 cytokine neutralization studies revealed the pivotal role of IFNg. In the model of TLR9-induced cytokine release syndrome, IFNg was shown to be critical for the development of some features of sHLH including cytopenias and hepatic dysfunction. 16, 17 Although these findings are intriguing, their relevance to the pathophysiology of human disease remains to be proven.'}, {'text': 'Studies of infections reveal many host-pathogen interactions, with genetic variation in both the host and the pathogen genomes (Garantziotis and Schwartz, 2010) . Many susceptibility genes are part of the innate or adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system notably recognizes common, conserved microbial antigens, now called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through toll-like receptors. The TLR2 receptor recognizes lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycans on Gram-positive bacterial or fungal walls, while TLR4 recognizes endotoxins in Gram-negative walls. G × E studies have had practical value in diagnosis, epidemiological surveillance, and targeted therapies of multiple infectious diseases. Genomics has played a critical role in understanding the evolution and pathogenicity of antigenic variation of influenza strains, origins of HIV/AIDS retroviruses, transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (and other viruses) from animals to humans, spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis, and highly differential susceptibility to the vivax form of malaria (Omenn, 2010b) . Hyporesponsive TLR4 polymorphisms and a CD14 SNP associated with higher circulating levels of CD14 are associated with increased mortality from sepsis in adults and from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk infants due to prematurity or congenital heart disease. SNPs in the vitamin D receptor gene VDR are associated with increased susceptibility to severe RSV and tuberculosis (TB). Conversely, an S180L TIRAP polymorphism is associated with reduced response to TLR2 and TLR4 activation in vitro and risk for developing TB.

Studies conducted in the Virgin Islands and Mali (Griffin et al., 2001a; Kellogg et al., 2004 ) that analyzed microbial composition in air samples taken during dust storm and normal atmospheric conditions demonstrated that the presence of plant pathogens and opportunistic human pathogens in dust-associated samples ranged between 5% and 27% of the total culturable population. One of the clearest cases of the influence of dust storms on human health is the epidemic of meningitis that annually affects the area known as the \"Sahel Meningitis Belt.\" This disease affects more than 200,000 people, mainly children, between February and May of every year (Sultan et al., 2005) . In the last 15 years there have been ∼800,000 cases, ∼10% of which have been fatal (World Health Organization, 2012) ; in 2010, out of approximately 22,000 cases, there were 2,400 fatalities. During the winter, the increase of Harmattan winds creates conditions that favor outbreaks and cases of meningitis, because low humidity and the inhalation of airborne dust particles can compromise the integrity of the airway mucosa. This allows the pathogen, Neisseria meningitides that is residing as nasal flora or that may be present in the dust, access past the host\\'s innate immune system. As soon as the wet season begins, the number of cases decreases considerably. The first epidemic studied was in 1841, and since then around 500 outbreaks have been registered in different regions of \"The Sahel Belt\" (Molesworth et al., 2003) . Fungi spores, such as Coccidioides immitis, the causative agent of the human disease known as coccidiomycosis or \"Valley Fever\" (Welsh et al., 2012) , are also common passengers in dust storms. This pathogen is a fungus exclusive to the Americas and is a common community member of the southwestern soils in the United States, where outbreaks of the disease have been shown to be due to regional dust-storm exposures (CDC, 2003; Jinadu, 1995) . Viruses are also suitable for airborne transport; they may be more easily aerosolized due to their smaller size, but also may be more sensitive to adverse conditions during transport. There is, however, airborne transmission of viruses, some of them responsible for global epidemics such as influenza or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Booth et al., 2005; Tseng and Li, 2008) . Hantaviruses, which regularly affect rodents and are shed in their feces, are known to occur in arid environments. When the feces become desiccated, the viruses may become aerosolized and may infect exposed humans (Griffin, 2007) . Recently, in September 2012, a Hantavirus outbreak occurred in Yosemite National Park, the United States, affecting 10 people, of which three cases were fatal (CDC, 2012) . Bacteriophages have been found to occur as high as 1.1 × 10 7 viruses per gram of soil in deserts; this demonstrates that viruses are a major biocomponent of any dust storm (Gonzalez-Martin et al., 2013) .'}, {'text': 'The most profound and most noted consequence of human senescence is the increased susceptibility to infections. Upper respiratory bacterial and urinary tract infections are frequent in the older population and less contained by the innate immune system and preexisting adaptive immunity. Not surprisingly, the immune system of an older adult is not able to induce a protective response to new antigens to which the individual has not been exposed to in the past. Clinically important examples are the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and West Nile fever virus infection. First-time vaccinations with live viruses, for example, yellow fever virus, are associated with increased morbidity and even mortality in older adults. Despite annual vaccination, influenza infections continue to be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pneumonia caused by RSV, usually example is the acquisition of memory-like and effector phenotypes with lymphopenia-induced homeostatic proliferation. So-called virtual memory cells, which presumably have never seen an exogenous antigen, have been identified in mouse models; clonal expansions are also seen within the human naïve T-cell compartment.

Nevertheless, diabetes has been uniformly reported to be associated with poor prognosis in other viral infections, notably seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza A H1N1 (2009), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [5] [6] [7] [8] . Multiple explanations can be put forward for this apparent association between pre-existing DM and COVID-19 severity. Innate immunity, the first line of defense against SARS-CoV-2, is inevitably compromised in patients with uncontrolled DM thereby allowing unhindered proliferation of the pathogen within the host [9] . Even short-term hyperglycemia has been shown to transiently stun the innate immune system [10] . Moreover, DM is characterized by exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response, notably interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108132 0168-8227/Ó 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-a, in the absence of appropriate immunostimulation; this may be further exaggerated in response to a stimulus as seen in patients with COVID-19 complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9] . The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the association between DM and COVID-19 is plausible. ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein that is constitutively expressed by the epithelial cells of the lungs, kidney, intestine and blood vessels. In normal physiology, ACE2 breaks down angiotensin-II and to a lesser extent, angiotensin-I to smaller peptides, angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin (1-9), respectively [11] . ACE2/Ang (1-7) system plays an important anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant role protecting the lung against ARDS; indeed ACE2 has been shown to be protective against lethal avian influenza A H5N1 infection [12] . ACE2 expression is reduced in patients with DM possibly due to glycosylation; this might explain the increased predisposition to severe lung injury and ARDS with COVID-19 [4, 11] .'}, {'text': 'Wildlife is believed to be responsible for approximately 40% of the emerging infectious diseases in humans (Quan et al., 2013) .

Along with these characteristics, the immune system of bats is also believed to be one reason why bats can act as a reservoir host for viruses. However, as the first defense against viral infection, the innate immune system of bats is still poorly understood.'}, {'text': \"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) uses a novel mechanism to induce the accelerated degradation of cellular mRNAs in SARS-CoV-infected cells [113, 114] . Nsp1 inhibits the translation of host mRNAs at the initiation step and induces an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in the 5' UTR of capped host mRNAs [115] [116] [117] . These functions require the binding of nsp1 to the 40S ribosomal subunit that allows nsp1 to inactivate the translation function of the ribosome and also gain access to actively translating host mRNAs [116, 117] . Notably, viral mRNAs are immune to nsp1-mediated RNA cleavage and the leader sequence, which is present in the 5'-end of all SARS-CoV mRNAs, protected the viral mRNAs from nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage [115] . Unlike the herpesvirus vhs and SOX proteins, SARS-CoV nsp1 does not possess any intrinsic nuclease activity and possibly, recruits a cellular endonuclease, the identity of which is still unknown. Furthermore, nsp1 does not target any specific sequence in the mRNA substrate for cleavage [115] . Like KSHV SOX protein, the nsp1-induced mRNA endonuclease activity liberates the cellular mRNAs from the rate-limiting steps of the default deadenylation-dependent decay pathway and the internally cleaved mRNA substrate is degraded by Xrn1-mediated exonucleolytic decay [110] . Importantly, the outcome of the selective degradation of host mRNAs induced by SARS-CoV nsp1 along with the escape of viral mRNAs from nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage is the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, including antiviral proteins, and the efficient accumulation of viral proteins in SARS-CoV-infected cells [114] . The nucleoprotein (NP) of Lassa fever virus (LASV), in the family Arenaviridae, possesses a 3'-5' exoribonuclease activity with specificity for dsRNA substrates [118, 119] . The exonuclease activity in LASV NP has been mapped to the C-terminal half of the protein, which also contains residues that are critical for its suppressive effect on the innate IFN response [118, 119] . In line with the overlap of these functional domains in NP, studies have demonstrated that the exonuclease activity of LASV NP is essential for its ability to suppress the innate immune system [118, 119] .\"}, {'text': 'The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against pathogens [1] . Early recognition and uptake of microbes by host professional phagocytes, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are crucial for downstream immune responses and pathogen clearance. Phagocytic cells express a range of cellular receptors, known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), involved in the sensing of microorganisms [1] . These proteins bind to conserved microbial ligands, promoting phagocytosis and antigen presentation, and trigger intracellular signaling and cytokine secretion. The quality of this initial pathogen recognition can have important consequences in both the outcome of infection and the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Two particular PRRs of the C-type lectin receptor family-dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin related (L-SIGN, also known as DC-SIGNR)-have recently been the focus of considerable attention [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . These two lectins, which can act as both cell adhesion receptors and pathogen recognition receptors, are encoded by two genes located on chromosome 19p13.2-3 within a ϳ26 kb segment [7, 8] . DC-SIGN and L-SIGN exhibit high nucleotide (73%) and aminoacid (77%) identity, and identical exon-intron organization [8] . An additional characteristic of both lectins is the presence of a neck region, made up of primarily 7 highly conserved 23 amino acid repeats, that separates the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) involved in pathogen binding from the transmembrane region. In regard to expression profiles, DC-SIGN is expressed mainly on endocytic cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas L-SIGN is expressed on endothelial cells in liver and lymph nodes, and in cells lining placental capillaries [9 -11] . DC-SIGN and L-SIGN share the ability to bind high-mannose oligosaccharides through their CRD, and have been shown to recognize a vast range of microbes, such as HIV-1, Ebola, Hepatitis-C virus, severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARS)-coV, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [12, 13] .'}, {'text': \"PEDV genome consists of a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome of approximately 28kb.

The replicases 1a and 1b of the nonstructural proteins play a pivotal role in viral genome replication. Studies [10] . Interferons (IFNs) are class II cytokines characterized by the cellular antiviral effects and are also key components of innate immunity in response to viral infection. It is generally believed that the type I (IFNα, IFN-β) and type III IFNs (IFN-λ2, IFN-λ3) play essential roles in antiviral defense [11] . Many viruses, including coronaviruses, have evolved strategies to counteract the signaling cascades of the innate immune system, especially through inhibiting IFN signaling and reduction of IFN production [12] . Viral proteins from different viruses, including influenza virus [13] , Herpes virus [14] , Coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [15] , Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) [16] and PEDV [17] have been identified as IFN antagonists. The mechanism involved in viral infection can be reflected through interactions between host-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) at the cellular level [18] . Although the Vero E6 cell line lacks the ability to transcribe type I IFNs as these cells possess a genetic deletion, research has indicated that the cells mount a weak initial IRF3-dependent response to various ligands, inducing a weak innate response to viruses [19] . With respect to coronaviruses, upon IFNs binding to the corresponding receptors, a downstream signaling is initiated and acts to block one or more steps in the virus life cycle [20] . Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a vital role in monitoring the availability of nutrients, mitogenic signals and cellular energy, and is a necessary part of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) cell survival pathway [21] . It has been shown that the genes related to the mTOR signaling pathway are differentially expressed at different times post-PEDV infection stages [22, 23] . However, the function of the mTOR signaling pathway in Vero E6 cells post-PEDV infection remains unknown. In this study, we have used a transcriptomic shotgun sequencing (RNA-Seq) procedure in Vero E6 cells to study gene responses against PEDV infection. This technique has previously been well documented in the study of PRRSV [24] . Genome-wide analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed in PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells. The analysis of genes in the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway suggested that the mTOR signaling pathway enacted a critical role in antiviral response against PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells. Results indicated that both mTOR activator-MHY1485 and inhibitor-PP242 modulated the PEDV infection rate in Vero E6 cells.\"}, {'text': 'The innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogenic invasion (Tarakhovsky and Kroemer, 2012) . Type I/II interferons (IFNs) are critical for generating cell intrinsic antiviral activity and hindering pathogens infection by inducing expression of a large number of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) . The human IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) was recently identified as a new antiviral effector of the ISGs family. Overexpression of IFITM3 blocks infection of a wide range of highly pathogenic enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), West Nile virus, dengue virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, as well as one non-enveloped reovirus (Anafu et al., 2013; Brass et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011; Weidner et al., 2010) .'}, {'text': \"Trying to understand the countless and complex pathogen-host interactions and intra-and inter-cellular signalling events that occur during the course of infectious disease is indeed a formidable task. Systems biology approach revealed that the tissue tropism of West Nile Virus is regulated by antiviral genes and innate immune systems cellular processes. The actions of the RIG-I like receptor (RLR) and type I interferon (IFN) signalling pathways are essential for a protective innate immune response against the emerging flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV). In mice lacking RLR or IFN signalling pathways, WNV exhibits enhanced tissue tropism, indicating that specific host factors of innate immune defence restrict WNV infection and dissemination in peripheral tissues (Bonneau, 2008) . A similar approach identified different regulatory networks targeted by Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus (KSHV miR-K12-11) in B cells and endothelial cells. Using a systems biology approach, it was inferred that miR-K12-11 (an ortholog of the human tumour gene hsa-miR-155.) establishes its (gene regulatory networks) GRN by both repressing master TFs and influencing signalling pathways, to counter the host anti-viral response and to promote proliferation and survival of infected cells. The targeted GRNs were more reproducible and informative than target gene identification, and this approach could be applied to other regulatory factors of interest. This systems approach revealed that miR-K12-11 opposes host defences and contributes to the proliferation and survival of KSHV infected cells by influencing key elements in cellular GRNs like TFs and signalling proteins (Yang et al., 2014) . Aevermann et al., 2014 analysed 47 transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from 30 studies generated by SysBio centers and made them available in public domain. These studies characterised the host response to infection by members of the Orthomyxoviridae and Coronaviridae virus families, including pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Storey et al., 2005) . This collection represented the first coordinated effort to create a systems level description of host-pathogen interactions using multiple viral strains, host models, and '-omics' technologies. Systems biology approaches has been used by Katze laboratory in depth, and their research is focused to define and model virus-host interactions, innate immune signaling, and the varied strategies used by viruses; (Wang et al., 2009; Law et al., 2013; Josset et al., 2013; Cheung et al., 2012; Diamond et al., 2012; Navare et al., 2012; Aderem et al., 2011; Li et al., 2015; Murali et al., 2011; Rasmussen et al., 2011) .\"}, {'text': 'Recently, interest in influenza vaccination strategies aiming at the induction of cross-protective immune response against heterosubtypic virus strains has revived. These strategies target activation of cross-protective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses directed against conserved viral proteins, i.e. nucleoprotein (NP) . In this respect whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccine can be considered a good vaccine candidate. Stimulation of MHC class I-restricted CTL activity by non-infectious vaccines, such as WIV, could be achieved through cross-presentation by dendritic cells (DCs). This process involves endocytosis of antigen, processing of antigen by cytosolic proteasomes and transportation through the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into MHC class I-loading compartments. Due to the fusogenic capacity of the virus, delivery of the nucleocapsid (and NP), into the cytosol is an active process mediated by the virus itself. Since virus inactivation protocols used to produce WIV vaccine can compromise viral fusion activity, they potentially could diminish WIV immunogenicity in terms of CTL induction. We therefore investigated to what extent fusion activity contributes to cross-presentation using untreated and 0.5% formaldehyde (FA) treated WIV as a model for fusion active and inactive particles, respectively. We found that fusion inactivation did not reduce in vitro maturation of bone marrow-derived DCs in response to WIV uptake nor upregulation of IL-12 gene expression and IL-12p70 production. Fusion inactivation of WIV did not reduce MHC class I-restricted presentation of a NP-derived epitope to previously primed CTLs in vitro. However, fusion activity played a significant role in priming of NP-specific CTLs in vivo, as demonstrated by in vivo cytotoxicity assay. From these data we conclude that fusion activity of WIV is beneficial in priming of CTL in unprimed individuals (the very young), but does not contribute to boosting of CTL responses in individuals primed for influenza by infection earlier in life (adolescent, adults, the elderly). Rapid induction of type I interferon (IFN) expression is a central event in the establishment of the innate immune response against viral infection, and requires the activation of multiple transcriptional proteins following engagement and signaling through Toll-like receptor-dependent and -independent pathways. Many viruses therefore encode factors that subvert the IFN system to enhance their virulence. Most viruses belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae encode nonstructural proteins to subvert this innate immune response. For this purpose viruses belonging to the subfamily paramyxovirinae use proteins encoded by alternative reading frames within the phospoprotein (P) gene. Members of the subfamily pneumovirinae (such as RSV) use the NS1 and NS2 proteins as antagonistic proteins. The human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a causative agent of severe respiratory tract illness, and belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae, subfamily pneumovirinae. HMPV does not encode a P gene with alternative reading frames or proteins related to the NS1 and NS2 of RSV. So far, little is known about the interaction between hMPV and the innate immune system. We demonstrate that hMPV blocks the IFN production pathway at early time points after infection. Upon infection of A549 cells with the prototype strain (hMPV NL/1/00) transcripts for the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA-5, as well as transcripts for the IFN genes were not up regulated. In addition, the virus did not induce translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus, and the virus was able to block IRF3 translocation induced by Sendai virus infections. Thus, like other paramyxoviruses , hMPV counteracts the innate immune system at early stages after infection, however hMPV must use a novel mechanism to do so. The type III interferon (IFN) family (IFN-k1, 2, and 3) elicits an antiviral response that is nearly identical to that evoked by IFN-a/b, but these cytokines signal through a receptor that displays a more tissue-specific distribution in vivo. The rapid non-cytolytic IFN-a/b-mediated inhibition of virus replication is particularly important in the central nervous system (CNS), where virus-or immune-mediated destruction of infected neurons is detrimental to the host. However, not much is known regarding the antiviral activity of IFN-k in the brain. Although IFN-k has little antiviral activity against certain mouse pathogens in the brain, human neurons have been reported to be capable of both producing and responding to this cytokine. We found that intranasal or intracranial infection of mice with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induced IFN-k2 mRNA expression in the brain, and that human IFN-k1 and k2 mRNA expression were induced by VSV infection in cultured primary human brain cells. Although the relative magnitude of IFN-k induction was substantial, its expression level was still nevertheless low on an absolute basis. In addition, we found that IFN-k induced the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in multiple human CNS cell types, including primary neurons, astrocytes, and choroid plexus epithelial and endothelial cells. However, the magnitude of ISG expression induced by IFN-k was lower than that activated by IFN-a, and as a consequence, provided a lower level of protection against subsequent virus challenge. These results show that while IFN-k may provide some protection against virus infection in human brain cells, it appears to play a minor role compared to IFN-a/b. These studies also further support the idea that due to its modest activity in the brain, therapeutic use of IFN-k for chronic HCV infection may cause fewer of the neurological side effects that are associated with IFN-a therapy. The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is likely mediated by disproportional immune responses and the ability of the virus to circumvent innate immunity. Although, SARS-CoV is able to block the production of type I interferons (IFNs) in most cell types, human plamacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) have been shown to produce IFNa upon SARS-CoV infection. In contrast, little is known about type I IFN production in SARS-CoV infected mice. In vivo a modest upregulation of IFNb mRNA but no induction of IFNa is observed in BALB/c mice. To examine the IFN response after SARS-CoV infection in mice, murine pDCs derived from BALB/c and BL6 mice were infected with SARS-CoV after which IFN responses were analyzed using RT-PCR and ELISA. The mRNA levels for IFNa, IFNb and IFNk were upregulated 10-100 times in SARS-CoV infected pDCs, suggesting a potent IFN response in these cells. At the protein level, however, only IFNa could be detected after SARS-CoV infection. Similar results were obtained with heat inactivated SARS-CoV and influenza virus. In contrast, the specific pDC stimulator CpG-ODN induced IFNa, IFNb and IFNk both at the mRNA level and at the protein level, showing that these cells are capable of producing these different IFN proteins. Interestingly, pDCs derived from BL6 mice infected with SARS-CoV produced more IFNa protein than pDCs from BALB/c mice, consistent with higher IFNa mRNA levels. This study shows that murine pDCs are able to produce IFNa after SARS-CoV infection but the production of IFNb and IFNk seems to be blocked at the translational level. The tight regulation of IFN production in pDCs with respect to IFN subtypes and genetic background may be important in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. The immediate-early phase of the host innate response to viral infection is initiated through pathogen recognition and expression of early protective genes such as type I interferon (IFN). Here, we performed a genome-scale RNA interference screen to identify positive and negative regulators of the innate response to Sendai virus infection. In a primary screen, an individually arrayed library of lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting 16,000 human genes was used to knock down each gene (in pools of 3 shRNA per gene) of a 293T cell line stably expressing the luciferase gene under the control of the IFN-b promoter. Using the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) as a ranking metric, we selected 600 candidate genes (300 positive and 300 negative regulators) whose silencing significantly modulated the reporter activity. This cell-based assay was validated by identifying known positive regulators such as IRF3, MAVS, c-Rel, RelA/p65 and IKKb. Bioinformatics analysis of gene ontology (GO) biological process and molecular function categories identified significantly enriched terms, such as eight members of the IjB kinase/NF-jB cascade among 300 positive regulators, representing a fold enrichment of 3.7 (P = 0.006). All candidate genes are being re-confirmed and tested in secondary screens using individual shRNA-expressing lentiviruses (minimum of 5 shRNA per gene) to minimize the selection of potential off-target hits. The secondary screens were designed to define the step in which newly identified regulators are positioned in the antiviral signaling cascade. The approach described in this study will provide significant insight for novel regulators of the host innate response to viral infection. Data from primary and secondary screens will be presented. The Type I IFN subtypes are often relatively species selective, which makes crossspecies experiments difficult to interpret. The Syrian golden hamster and Norwegian rat are common rodent models, and two macaques, rhesus and cynomolgus, are common non-human primate models for a variety of viral infections. The alpha interferon subtypes from these species are mostly unavailable and hence either mouse or human IFN subtypes will frequently be used in these model systems. In order to understand which mouse or human alpha IFN subtypes could be used in cross-species experiments, we have established antiviral cytopathic effect inhibition assays on rhesus macaque (LLC-MK2/VSV), cynomolgus macaque (JTC-12/EMCV), Syrian golden hamster (BHK-21/VSV) and norwegian rat (C6/VSV) cell lines. All 14 mouse alpha IFNs were tested on the hamster and rat cells and all 12 of the human subtypes were tested on the rhesus and cynomolgus cell lines. In general, most of the mouse IFN-alpha subtypes exhibited activity on the other rodent cells and most of the human IFN-alpha subtypes displayed activity on the macaque cells. However, there are several notable exceptions with certain subtypes having little of no activity in the cross-species assay. The results of this study may be used to identify and select IFN-alpha subtypes that can be best used in the relevant animal model system.'}, {'text': \"To antagonize the host innate immune response, coronaviruses have developed various strategies to evade defenses and successfully infected host cells.

PRRs are localized on the cell surface, in the endosome, or in the cytosol and function to detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) present in microbial invaders and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) exposed upon the occurrence of damage to cells [1] . The compartmentalization of these PRRs provides spatial information for better microbial detection. The accumulation of these receptor-mediated signals leads to the development of optimal immunity against pathogens. PAMPs are important structural components necessary for the survival of microorganisms and appear to have been highly conserved along the course of evolution. For example, in bacteria, PAMPs are mainly found in the components of the cell wall. The recognition of PAMPs mainly depends on 20-40 PRR proteins in the innate immune system in mammals. Most opportunistic pathogens contain at least one PAMP within their structural range, and evolutionary pressure drives the human immune system to selectively recognize only the most prevalent and conserved PAMPs. Nevertheless, the recognition of only a limited number of PAMPs bears risks because some pathogens can evade immune detection through mechanisms such as losing PAMPs or structural modification of PAMPs [2] . To overcome these challenges, such defects can be compensated for by the development of more sophisticated recognition systems by the innate immune system [3] . Recently, a recognition system of homeostasis-altering molecular processes involving inflammasome components, such as NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR-and pyrin domain-containing 3) and pyrin that integrate signals from perturbations in cytoplasmic homeostasis has been shown to promote great flexibility in the innate immune system, enabling this system to sense evolutionarily novel infections [4] . There are four major groups of PRR protein families, including the Toll-like receptor (TLR), C-type lectin receptor (CLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR) and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) families. The importance of PRRs in viral infections has been demonstrated in RIG-I-deficient mice in which viral infections fail to induce a type I interferon (IFN) reaction [5] . RIG-I preserves several critical regions, including the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), a DECH helicase, and a C-terminal domain. Together, these subunits sense signals and mediate downstream signal transduction. The crystal structures of RIG-I reveal that the CARD domain, which mediates CARD-CARD interactions, is sequestered by a helical domain inserted between the two helicase moieties in the inactive status. Once RIG-I binds the 5′-triphosphate double-stranded RNA (5′-ppp-dsRNA) of viruses through its C-terminal domain, the CARD domain is exposed leading to its release from the helicase domain and triggers downstream signaling [6] .\"}, {'text': 'The pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) arose from Guangdong Province of China in November 2002, and eventually infected > 8500 people worldwide. 1, 2 The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged from the Arabian Peninsula in 2012, was globally identified in 941 laboratory-confirmed cases with 347 related deaths until December 26, 2014, according to the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 26-december-2014-mers/en/). The CoV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of w30 kb; it contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) and encodes replicase (ORF1a and ORF1ab), structural proteins (spike, nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope), and accessory proteins (ORF 3a, ORF 3b, ORF6, ORF 7a, ORF 7b, ORF 8a, ORF 8b, and ORF 9b). 3 These accessory proteins could be dispensable for virus replication, but might have a specific function in viral infection. ORF3 and ORF 7a proteins activate JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling, upregulate interleukin-8 and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), and modulate apoptosis and cell cycle. 4, 5 ORF 3b and ORF6 proteins modulate the host innate immune response, including inhibition of Type I IFN production and signaling. 4, 5 The SARS-CoV ORF6 protein localizes in the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in infected cells 6 ; ORF6 overexpression triggers the ER stress in transfected cells. 7 The ORF6 protein is dispensable for viral replication in vitro and in vivo, 8 but associates with viral escape from the innate immune system, particularly inhibition of Type I interferon (IFN) production and signaling pathways. 7, 9 ORF6 protein interacts with the C terminus of karyopherin alpha 2, leading to impeding the nuclear import of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in response to IFN-b. Thus, SARS-CoV ORF6 protein is an antagonist of Type I IFNs. In this study, we identified cellular ORF6-interacting factors using phage display human lung cDNA library, further examining the association of SARS-CoV ORF6 and host factors in Type I IFN antagonism. The C terminus of nuclear pore complex interacting protein NPIPB3 (nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, member B3; Gene ID: 23117), also known as phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog, displayed on phage surface showed the highest binding affinity to recombinant ORF6 protein.

Under disease conditions the molecules involved are relatively regulation and result in selective recruitment of NK cells. Our recently study showed that the expression of LSECtin in liver tissue from patients with various liver diseases was different. The expression of LSECtin in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue is lower. The expression of LSECtin in chronic active hepatitis was higher. Some research proved that the NK cells promote chronic infection by limiting CD8 þ T-cell immunity during virus infection [26] . In addition, LSECtin is a novel regulator of T cells and expose a crucial mechanism for hepatic T-cell immune suppression. In this study, we demonstrate that LSECtin is an important regulator for modulating hepatic NK cells and involves the innate immune responses. So LSECtin is not only an activated T cells but also a NK cells modulator in the liver.

It can be activated by a cascade mechanism of the classical pathway (CP), alternative pathway (AP), or the lectin pathway (Carroll and Fischer, 1997) . However, a wealth of data has clearly demonstrated that undesired activation of complement is responsible for the initiation, amplification or perpetuation of tissue damage and inflammation in a number of pathological situations (Morgan and Harris, 2003) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an emerging infectious disease with severe mortality, affected many countries in 2003 and the coronavirus is the etiologic agent (Peiris et al., 2003) . In terms of pathogenesis of SARS, viral load in the first phase may in turn result in host inflammatory response during the second phase. The SARS complications are associated with severe inflammatory tissue destruction due to excessive activation of the innate immune system and a notable proportion of the patients progressed to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in the later phase of viral infection (Li et al., 2003) . Considerable clinical and experimental evidence implicated that complement appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of these late post-viral complications, which could even be predicted by increased complement activations (Sahu and Lambris, 2000; Abe, 2006; Sarma et al., 2006) .

This disease is associated with an extensive lymphopenia with up to 90% of the lymphocytes disappearing from the peripheral blood. Numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, B cells, neutrophils and monocytes are reduced leading to a temporary, MV-associated immunosuppression rendering humans highly susceptible to opportunistic infections (Okada et al., 2000; Niewiesk et al., 2000; Naniche et al., 2000; Nanan et al., 1999) . The mechanisms of MV-induced immune suppression are still not fully understood and are most likely multifactorial (Marttila et al., 2001) . It has been discussed that MV suppresses cell-mediated immunity by interfering with the survival and functions of dendritic cells and T cells (Fugier-Vivier et al., 1997) . Cell membrane-associated MV components inhibit antigen processing (Marttila et al., 2001) . It has been speculated that the production of a soluble factor can inhibit antigen-specific T cell proliferation and the proliferation of uninfected B cells (Fujinami et al., 1998) . However, the mechanism of MV induced lymphopenia is unknown. During natural infection the preferential target cells infected are monocytes and not lymphocytes (Nanan et al., 1999) , corresponding to the results obtained in the present study with CDV. In Measles, the number of MV-infected cells remains a minor population, and therefore cytolysis of viralinfected lymphocytes alone cannot explain the profound immune suppression. In the acute phases of CDV-induced lymphopenia this also appears to be the case. With Measles, it has been suggested that lymphopenia is primarily due to extended death of non-infected blood cells caused by apoptosis (Okada et al., 2000) . This again is related to the observation made in the present study with CDV. In the acute phase of many other virus infections a lymphopenia with characteristics as those presented here can be observed (Oldstone, 1996) . Examples include classical swine fever (Summerfield et al., 1998 , bovine viral diarrhea (Ridpath et al., 2000) , porcine Circovirus-2 infection (Nielsen et al., 2003) , influenza (Tumpey et al., 2000) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Peiris et al., 2003) , foot and mouth disease (Bautista et al., 2003) , Dengue virus infection (Fadilah et al., 1999) , cytomegalovirus infection (Einsele et al., 1993) , and many others. Interestingly, in many cases a correlation of disease severeness and degree of lymphocyte depletion was observed. Based on this, the determination of lymphocyte numbers can have a prognostic value for the development of the disease. The mechanism of this lymphocyte depletion in the acute phase of virus infections is unknown. A nonspecific (over-)activation of the innate immune system to a rapidly replicating virus in a naïve host might be involved. The effects could be mediated by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and interferons, which in turn affect lymphocyte homeostasis.'}, {'text': 'Diseases caused by coronavirus is a hot research topic in recent years, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED).

While these viruses are highly pathogenic in other mammals, experimental studies and field observations have shown that bats rarely display clinical signs upon viral infection (Williamson et al., 1998; Calisher et al., 2006; Middleton et al., 2007; Towner et al., 2009; van den Hurk et al., 2009) .

Recently, HMGB1 has been found that it acts as an early mediator of inflammation and cell injury during myocardial I/R [7] . These results suggest that HMGB1 play an important role in myocardial I/R injury. However, HMGB1 has been recognized as a member of endogenous compounds, called \"alarmins,\" which serve as danger signals to promote activation of the innate immune system in response to tissue injury as a result of trauma, I/R, or infection [8] . Izuishi et al [4] indicated that pretreatment of mice with HMGB1 protected against hepatic I/R injury and blunted the inflammatory response to this insult. And then, recently they found that preconditioning with HMGB1 could also induce LPS tolerance during hepatic I/R [8] , indicating that preconditioning with HMGB1 may also protect against myocardial I/R injury as well as LPS.'}, {'text': 'Asthma is classically defined as a disease orchestrated by the adaptive immune system. However, recent advances suggest considerable crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune systems in initiation and propagation of allergic immune response. 5 Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors, are key components of the innate immune system that have been found to play an important role in allergic inflammation. PRRs on epithelial cells and dendritic cells (DCs) recognize pathogenassociated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns and act as adjuvants in directing allergen sensitization. [6] [7] [8] Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a prototypic soluble PRR involved in the regulation of inflammation through multiple mechanisms that include interaction with components of complement pathways, Fcg receptors, pathogenic moieties on microbes, and regulation of leukocyte migration. 9 Previously, lack of PTX3 has been reported to exaggerate inflammation in the setting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, aspergillosis, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice. The protective role of exogenous PTX3 in aspergillosis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis further strengthens the preceding observations (reviewed by Balhara et al 9 ) . Collectively, these studies demonstrate that infection and lung injury increase PTX3 production in the lung. 9 Previously published data by our group 10 showed enhanced PTX3 expression in the lungs of patients with severe allergic asthma compared with that in healthy donors. Structural cells, particularly epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells, were the main producers of PTX3 in vivo and on proinflammatory cytokine stimulation in vitro. However, the role of PTX3 in the development of allergic asthma remains unknown.'}]\n"

      "[{'text': 'Because DNA vaccines induce long-lasting humoral and cellular immunity, they are a powerful tool in the fight against infectious diseases. Genetic vaccinations comprise eukaryot-ic expression plasmids that are inoculated into target cells, which then translate them and express the antigens. The efficacy of this technique correlates with the inflammation induced in muscle cells at the site of DNA vaccination, which causes the release of \"danger signals\" that induce local inflammatory responses and recruit immune cells to the site of vaccination. In this context, co-administration of plasmid DNA along with adjuvant-like cytokine genes, liposomes, or hyaluronidase, substantially improves the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . The protective immunity conferred by DNA vaccines has been illustrated using animal models, including those infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza virus, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [49] [50] [51] . DNA vaccines have proved successful in pre-clinical and clinical trials [52] [53] [54] . In addition, passive immune-prophylaxis using viral vectors or plasmids encoding neutralizing antibodies induces the long-term expression of antibodies at high concentrations, and provides effective protection against influenza virus or HIV infection [55] [56] [57] [58] . AIM2, which recognizes cytosolic dsDNAs of self-and nonself-origin, including viral DNA, combines with the adaptor protein ASC to form a caspase-1-activating inflammasome [59] . A recent report shows that the electrotransfer of plasmid DNA into murine skeletal muscle augments the expression of genes associated with intracellular DNA sensors, including AIM2 [60] . This suggests that the AIM2 inflammasome pathway is required for the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. In fact, AIM2 knockout mice show a significantly reduced antihemagglutinin (HA) antibody response after immunization with a DNA vaccine expressing the HA of influenza virus [61] . Interestingly, blocking IL-1 signaling did not significantly affect the anti-HA antibody responses. Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms by which the AIM2 inflammasome pathway enhances antibody responses after DNA vaccination.'}]\n",
      "[{'text': 'One innate inflammatory pathway is the inflammasome. The inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that forms in the cytosol following detection of a diverse range of ligands, and which is responsible for activation of caspase-1 (Martinon et al. 2002) . Caspase-1 in turn processes members of the IL-1 family of cytokines into their active forms (Howard et al. 1991; Thornberry et al. 1992; Gu et al. 1997; Ghayur et al. 1997) leading to their secretion. These cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-18, are pro-inflammatory and induce a variety of immunomodulatory effects, capable of leading to both host protection and damaging pathological response. IL-1α and IL-1β induce recruitment of neutrophils (Lee et al. 2015) , polarize T cells to adopt a Th17 phenotype (Chung et al. 2009 ), and promote DC activation for priming (Ichinohe et al. 2009; Ramos et al. 2012) . IL-18 signaling promotes production of interferon gamma (Okamura et al. 1995; Kohno et al. 1997; Bellora et al. 2012; Serti et al. 2014 ) and cytotoxicity (Okamura et al. 1995; Dao et al. 1996; Tsutsui et al. 1996) in a variety of cell types. Characterization of the role of the inflammasome and its related cytokines during viral infection is ongoing. While it has been shown that a viroporin protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, possibly contributing to disease severity (Nieto-Torres et al. 2015) and that inflammasome activation enhances pathology in a murine model of fulminant hepatitis (Guo et al. 2015) , little other data are available regarding inflammasome activation in the context of coronavirus infection.'}, {'text': 'Mitochondrial dysfunction can also cause NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Recently, it was found that newly synthesized mitochondrial DNA is crucial for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and that this process is dependent on the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide kinase CMPK2 .

They found that the plasma concentrations key proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 were not substantially increased in any of the patients throughout the course of illness. From this the authors stated that the cytokine results cast doubt on the liberal use of corticosteroids in paediatric SARS patients, as the host immunologic response did not seem to be as severe as initially anticipated. The authors provide evidence that SARS-CoV 3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages and that the ion channel activity of the 3a protein was essential for 3a-mediated IL-1β secretion. The macrophages obtained in this study were from 6-week-old female mice. Note.

Synergistic inhibition of MERS-CoV PLpro by disulfiram and 6-thioguanine or mycophenolic acid implies the potential for combination treatments using these three clinically available drugs. The combination of mycophenolic acid and interferon beta 1b shows synergistic activity against MERS-CoV in Vero cells. The desirable pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid compared to ribavirin warrants further evaluation, although the potential inhibitory effect on the immune system and therefore neutralising antibody production should be fully assessed in animal models before use in humans. A fatal case of MERS was reported in a renal transplant recipient who was receiving antirejection therapy consisting of prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine, but the dosage, serum drug level of mycophenolate mofetil, and resulting lymphocyte count were not reported [80] A review of candidate therapies for Middle East respiratory syndrome from a molecular perspective.

Amantadine is one of the best-studied and famous inhibitors for the influenza A virus M2 channel and has been used clinically as an anti-influenza drug for several years [90] . A drawback of amantadine is the high doses necessary to affect influenza. However, targeting the NLR inflammasome pathway in combination with ion channel inhibitors could be the way forward and could lead to beneficial treatments of viral respiratory disease. Figure 1 . The NLRP3 inflammasome in lung inflammation and injury from respiratory viruses. Recent evidence suggests that viroporins such as IAV M2, RSV SH, HRV 2B, and SARS E protein, cause dysregulation of ions (such as Na + , K + , or Ca 2+ ), leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3 activation leads to IL-1b secretion and lung injury, inflammation and virus clearance. Some viroporins permeabilize the plasma membrane (such as the IAV M2 and SARS E proteins), whereas others permeabilize intracellular compartments such as the Golgi (RSV SH and HRV 2B). Generalized permeabilization of both intracellular compartments (such as the Golgi and trans-Golgi network) as well as the plasma membrane by viroporins provokes this ionic imbalance. This ion influx triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and causes disease pathology in the lung.
